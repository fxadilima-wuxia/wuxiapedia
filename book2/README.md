# The Promised Land in the Western Horizon

This story is built upon the characters from Jin Yong's (Louis Cha) original work, titled 'Yitian Tulong Ji' or in English 'The Heavenly Sword and the Dragon Slaying Sabre', by exploring ideas within events that Jin Yong himself did not delve into.[^judul-asli]

[^judul-asli]: Yitian Tulong Ji (倚天屠龍記), commonly translated into Indonesian as 'Kisah Pedang Langit dan Golok Pembunuh Naga' (Tale of the Heavenly Sword and Dragon Slaying Sabre). However, the original five characters hold a much deeper meaning. 'Yitian' (倚天) can mean 'Heaven's Will' or, in ancient terms, 'Heaven's Mandate'. Meanwhile, 'Tulong' (屠龍) means 'Slaying the Dragon', and Ji (記) itself is 'Tale' or 'Legend'. Thus, we only get two poetic, myth-tinged phrases: 'Slaying the Dragon by following Heaven's Will'. Yet, throughout ancient Chinese history and folklore, 'Dragon' has always been associated with the reigning Emperor or his throne.

Reflecting more deeply on the meaning of the original title, there are actually no two important characters, 'Sword' (Jian 劍) or 'Saber' (Dao 刀) in that title. This is because, in Jin Yong's own narrative, these arose from various folk tales circulating at the time.

The Indonesian and English titles emerged from the popular poem within the story itself, and are associated with the appearance of two legendary weapons: 'Yitian Jian' (Heavenly Sword or Heaven's Sword) and 'Tulong Dao' (Dragon Slaying Saber).

The poem itself will be frequently quoted by Zhang Wuji throughout the story.

### Delving Deeper into the Original Story

Additional supporting characters and those adapted to the story's concept originate from the original version in Chapter 34, which can be found in [the English translation by fans of the story](https://foxswuxia.wordpress.com/condor-trilogy-heaven-sword-dragon-saber/yttlj-chapter-34/).

If we print that page into a PDF, on page 56 you will find the first face-to-face encounter between Zhang Wuji (Hokkien: Thio Buki) and Zhao Min's (Hokkien: Tio Beng) biological father, General Chaghan Temur, after Zhang Wuji was severely injured battling the Tibetan monks. At that time, Zhao Min had just disrupted Zhang Wuji's wedding ceremony with Zhou Zhiruo (Hokkien: Chow Cijiak), and the two of them then began their adventures.

The story in Jin Yong's work in this part feels somewhat odd:

- Chaghan Temur was originally never explicitly mentioned as a 'Wangye' (King or Prince) of the Yuan Dynasty, although he was truly a loyal defender of the Yuan Dynasty with very strong military influence. He eventually became the most powerful before he himself was killed on his way to Yidu.

- Chaghan Temur died at the young age of 34. He was born in 1328 AD and died on July 6, 1362, en route to Yidu. How could a Zhao Min in her twenties be present to accompany Zhang Wuji before his death?

- To make it plausible, I set Zhao Min's birth date according to the Gregorian calendar to September 15, 1342, which makes her born when Chaghan himself was 14 years old. I then brought to life the character 'Li Furen', a woman of Naiman descent (consistent with Chaghan's history) as Chaghan's first wife. Li Furen is 6 years older than Chaghan himself (common at that time among Yuan Dynasty officials). Thus, by the time Chaghan died, Zhao Min would only be twenty years old. This means she would have been a young girl, no more than 12 years old, when she disrupted Zhang Wuji's and Zhou Zhiruo's wedding ceremony. This aligns quite well with Jin Yong's basic idea, who explicitly stated that Zhang Wuji thought Zhao Min's interest was merely 'a little girl's puppy love', which would pass in due course.

- Wang Baobao was originally indeed named 'Wang Baobao', a Han descendant from the Wang family. He only later received a Mongolian name bestowed by Emperor Toghon Temur after successfully delivering supplies to Dadu. Jin Yong treated the adopted Han names of Mongolians as trivial comedic material. However, our story will completely reverse this, as Chaghan Temur was from the Naiman tribe, clearly a tribe conquered by Genghis Khan. History records that the Naiman tribe may have practiced Christianity or even Manichaeism, whereas Jin Yong foolishly depicted Chaghan as opposing Manichaeism (Ming Jiao or Beng Kauw).

- The appellation Li Furen for Zhao Min's biological mother becomes official because Chaghan himself often used the Han name Li Cha Han. Thus, for a woman, whose name was often not recorded or who only had informal names from close relatives, 'Li Furen' or 'Madam Li' is very natural for Zhao Min's mother.

- In that first meeting, after realizing his own daughter, who at the time was no more than twelve years old, had fallen in love with Zhang Wuji, it would have been natural for Chaghan Temur to provide much deeper guidance, rather than the somewhat cartoonish version written by Jin Yong (which could incite very serious racial fanaticism).

- The depiction of Toghon Temur might be reasonable: "Zhang Wuji focused his attention to see the Mongolian Emperor. He noticed that the Emperor’s countenance was thin, pallid, and dispirited. In just one glance it was obvious that he indulged in wine. The Crown Prince rode a horse next to the sedan chair. Contrary to his expectations, the Crown Prince actually showed a heroic spirit. He had a gilded long bow, inlaid with jade, on his shoulder; truly fit the image of a Mongolian young hero." — but the depiction of Ayushiridara there is somewhat exaggerated, considering Ayushiridara was actually the same age as Han Lin'er, who in Jin Yong's narrative was also present at the same event. They were both born in 1340. If you trace the course of events, this event itself could not have been later than 1353-1354 CE, before the death of Han Lin'er's father — Han Shantong. This means they were most likely no older than 14-year-old teenagers. Which raises several other questions:

- Zhang Wuji, as a leader with a pure and innocent soul, always prioritizing compassion, seeing a young Han Lin'er (13 or 14 years old), cursing the common Dadu citizens with hateful tones as 'Traitors!' because they praised the reigning emperor, and he supported that idea?

- The 'cruelty' of the Yuan Dynasty guard forces is explicitly shown, even cartoonishly, but Jin Yong does not balance it with the cruelty of the Southern Red Turban Rebellion forces against their opponents. This creates a very serious bias for naive readers.

- 'Mongolian officials' are depicted as very corrupt, deserving to be replaced by a 'new dynasty', but Jin Yong does not at all describe how corrupt the two 'new dynasties' formed after this were. Basically, the leaders in the south clashed among themselves, fighting for power that was not yet fully formed, not even supporting each other!

- The story of the Yuan Dynasty would feel incomplete and awkward if one only highlighted 'how great the Han people are' vs. 'how bad the Mongolians are', even to the point of making Empress Qi and Empress Bayan merely 'two middle-aged fat women', in the following quote: "The Emperor sat on the highest platform, with the two Empresses on either side of him. The Empresses were middle-age fat women, bundled inside robes inlaid with pearls, jade and precious jewels. Needless to say, they glittered with brilliant lights. On their heads, they wore ridiculously strange-looking tall crowns.", which can be found on page 19 if you print the link above to PDF as I suggested. A sudden thought arises:

- Empress Qi, 'Ki' or 'Gi', was a woman of Goryeo descent, born in Haengju, depicted as exceedingly beautiful, causing Emperor Toghon Temur to be infatuated with her and continuously attempting to make her 'Empress', not just an ordinary 'Consort'. Jin Yong ignored this very interesting point. Conversely, we will explore this historical fact in depth. Empress Qi was born in 1315, at this time she was not yet 40 years old!

- Empress Bayan was known as a simple woman, who never even wore luxurious clothes, yet Jin Yong describes both as "...bundled inside robes inlaid with pearls, jade and precious jewels"? Our story will depict the personal grandeur of Empress Bayan, combining her with a female character 'discarded' by Jin Yong, ending up as nothing more than a 'crazy girl' — Yin Li, as her adopted daugher.

- Manichaeism, which forms the main nuance of the story, in various places, naturally underwent adaptations to make it acceptable to local communities. This was not as simple and shallow as Jin Yong wrote, becoming merely a movement to expel barbarians. In the Yuan Dynasty era, it was Peng Yingyu, a real historical figure, who initiated that rebellion movement with his teachings, which originally did not contain phrases in this direction, but implicitly could indeed trigger a rebellion, and Peng Yingyu himself seemingly allowed it, or even deliberately encouraged it.

- A striking anomaly is stating that Persian Manichaeism taught its followers to have a 'Holy Maiden' as their leader. This is truly strange, considering Manichaeism itself originated from the faith experience of a Persian man named Mani, who was one hundred percent male. How could it then become a teaching that championed a woman as their leader? This point, in our story, troubles Xiao Zhao, who is clearly in love with, and loved by, Zhang Wuji!
