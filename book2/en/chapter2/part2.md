# 2. Xiangyang, 1355
## *The Strange Scholar by the Riverbank*

After dinner, they strolled along the riverbank, chatting about how Zhang Sanfeng had subdued all the Yuan soldiers back then. Suddenly, Zhang Wuji's eyes caught sight of a man staggering not far from where they stood. The man was dressed like a scholar and was holding a wine pouch. He appeared to be heavily drunk. While walking, rambling incoherently and mumbling poems, his foot tripped on a small stone, and he swayed forward. Zhang Wuji exerted his qinggong, moving as fast as lightning towards the man and supporting him, preventing him from falling into the river.

As if just waking from a dream, the scholar stared at Zhang Wuji, then turned to look at the two girls and Fan Yao, who were walking closer to them. He immediately checked his wine pouch anxiously, saying, "Oh dear, luckily it didn't spill!"

Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo couldn't help but laugh, giggling as they looked at the scholar, who was straightening his robe and hat, and smiling at Zhang Wuji. "Gongzi, what extraordinary kung fu! You saved my wine, marvelous, truly marvelous! I've never seen anything like it."

"Xiansheng has had too much to drink," Zhang Wuji said with a smile. "May Zaixia know where Xiansheng lives? We can escort Xiansheng home."

The scholar waved both hands in disagreement. "No need, no need to trouble yourselves," he said. "I'm not that old yet. I'm retired, but not that old!" He laughed, cupped his hands, then bowed and said, "May Zaixia know Gongzi's name? Zaixia's surname is Liu."

"Zaixia's surname is Zhang," Zhang Wuji replied. "Zhang Wuji."

"Ah, a good name," Liu Xiansheng said with a laugh. "It means 'No Envy.' Envy and jealousy truly corrupt people, and can even ruin a nation."

They could sense a bitter tone when he uttered that last sentence.

Zhao Min interjected, "Xiansheng seems like an official."

Liu Xiansheng shook his head, saying, "For twenty-five years I served the nation. I truly never imagined that a rebel would succeed in bribing one of my colleagues. Perhaps you won't believe it, but in the end, that rebel was even given an official position and office, complete with a rather high salary! I fought against rebels, but I ended up being ostracized!"

Zhang Wuji was shocked. He had not expected this person to be a Yuan Dynasty official. "And they eventually dismissed Xiansheng?" he asked.

Liu Xiansheng shook his head again. "I was very angry, so I tendered my resignation several times," he replied. "But they didn't accept it. Isn't that very strange? They ostracized me, but they also didn't want to lose me! Funny, very funny! When I protested, they finally sentenced me to death, on the grounds that I insulted the emperor! When did I insult the emperor? What I opposed was the person who accepted the bribe!"

Zhou Zhiruo asked, "Then how did Xiansheng manage to escape?"

"My best friend finally arranged something," Liu Xiansheng said. "The person who was beheaded really resembled me. Poor fellow..."

Zhang Wuji was greatly shocked. But before he could open his mouth, Zhao Min asked, "It seems Xiansheng's friend is Toqto'a, isn't that right?"

Now it was Liu Xiansheng who was surprised. He stared at Zhao Min in astonishment, then said, "You – little lady – are truly clever. Your guess is correct, it was indeed him." He let out a long, regretful sigh, then continued, "What a pity, in the end, he was also ousted."

He appeared to be deep in thought as he gazed at the river. A moment later, he spoke again, "You can take my word for it, as soon as this man is ousted, that will be the end of the Yuan Dynasty. They remove officials who truly serve the nation and replace them with sycophants."

"It sounds like Xiansheng is not a native of Xiangyang," Zhou Zhiruo said.

Liu Xiansheng observed Zhou Zhiruo intently, then said, "And Miss herself is actually from Xiangyang, or at least born around here, although Miss does not look like a Dongzu[^dongzu]. Your guess is also very accurate. I'm just passing through here for a moment. I heard Toqto'a was sent to Yunnan. I'm currently heading there. But I'm just looking for inspiration from this place. In the past, when the Heroic Couple Guo Jing and Huang Rong defended Xiangyang, the situation was almost similar. At that time, the Song Dynasty was controlled by Jia Sidao. But then Guo Jing and Huang Rong faithfully defended Xiangyang, to their last breath! Unfortunately, this Old Liu does not possess such grandeur."

[^dongzu]: Dongzu (侗族): The Dong ethnic group, native to Zhijiang.

Zhou Zhiruo said, "Xiansheng is an official, but he seems to have such great attention to the martial arts world."

"Heroes like Guo Jing and Huang Rong truly deserve to be remembered," Liu Xiansheng said with shining eyes. "These young ladies are still young, but they have very keen insights. You could guess my origins just by looking. I am truly impressed."

"Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min dare not accept Xiansheng's praise," Zhou Zhiruo said. "We were just guessing casually."

"Ah, so Miss was indeed born in Zhijiang," Liu Xiansheng said happily, as his guess was correct. "And you, little lady, you are actually Shaomin Junzhu, daughter of Chaghan Temur! Zhang Gongzi is truly fortunate to have companions like the two of you."

Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo's faces immediately flushed crimson. They didn't know how to respond to Liu Xiansheng's jest. Zhang Wuji was very surprised that Liu Xiansheng could guess Zhao Min's origins so easily. But remembering that he was formerly a Yuan Dynasty official, this was, of course, very reasonable, and it seemed he had no ill intentions whatsoever. He saw Liu Xiansheng quickly signaling them not to worry.

"You don't need to worry, although Zaixia was formerly an official, Zaixia was saved by a friend, who is also an official," he said. "How could Zaixia betray a friend? Chaghan Temur is a good official, but he is not a skilled speaker. His attitude in dealing with Hama and Bolad Temur will have bad consequences if continued. After experiencing misfortune due to the actions of fellow officials, Zaixia once warned him, but Chaghan would not listen." He stared intently at Zhang Wuji with a serious face, then continued, "Gongzi, Zaixia now wants to say something that might be unpleasant for Gongzi. But Zaixia hopes Gongzi will at least keep some of these things in your heart."

Zhang Wuji said, "If Xiansheng has advice, Zhang Wuji will gladly listen. Xiansheng, please speak freely."

Liu Xiansheng smiled, saying, "After hearing Miss Zhou and Miss Zhao's names, Zaixia knows that Gongzi is actually the Ming Jiao Leader. In this matter, Gongzi need not worry, because besides Zaixia no longer being an official, Zaixia is basically considered a dead man anyway." He paused for a moment, then his face turned more serious before continuing, "The movement Gongzi leads will eventually be disregarded by others. Some leaders who emerge from it will later compete with each other to unite Zhongyuan within their grasp, if not the entire territory currently under the Yuan Dynasty's power. However, at that time, they can still use Gongzi's name to justify their own actions. If something bad happens, Gongzi will be seen as at fault; conversely, if something good happens, Gongzi will still gain nothing."

Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo exchanged anxious glances. Zhao Min had long thought about this, and now Liu Xiansheng stated it very clearly.

At that moment, they heard Zhang Wuji say, "Xiansheng, if that is truly all Zhang Wuji can contribute for the well-being of the people in Zhongyuan, then let it all happen. Zhang Wuji is ready to accept all risks."

"Gongzi is a good person, Zaixia knows that," Liu Xiansheng said. "But has Gongzi ever thought that there are actually more things that would bring good to the people, which Gongzi could do, if Gongzi were to resign as Ming Jiao Leader at this moment? Gongzi, Miss Zhou, and Miss Zhao, are the Guo Jing and Huang Rong for the people of this era. But if Gongzi continues to remain within the Ming Jiao, Gongzi will only be manipulated by those who seek power and seek justification by using Gongzi's name."

Hearing their names equated with Guo Jing and Huang Rong, Zhang Wuji hurriedly said, "We dare not accept such great praise at all. But perhaps Xiansheng has a hint; if not with the Ming Jiao, then what could we do?"

Liu Xiansheng said, "Gongzi, the people who deserve to be saved, and whom Gongzi could genuinely help, are not only those who align with the Ming Jiao, or those of Han descent. If Gongzi meets these people, then Gongzi will know. But if Gongzi remains with the Ming Jiao, then Gongzi will overlook them."

After saying that, Liu Xiansheng smiled as he looked at the two girls standing beside Zhang Wuji, then said, "If Zaixia may suggest, Gongzi should not lose either of these two young ladies."

With that last sentence, Liu Xiansheng bowed and bid farewell, quickly departing from the spot. After he left, Zhang Wuji still watched his back until he disappeared into the darkness of the night. He pondered for a very long time, thinking about the meaning of Liu Xiansheng's words. Then suddenly he remembered something and said, "Oh no, I forgot to ask his full name!"

He intended to chase after Liu Xiansheng, but Zhao Min said, "No need to chase him, I know his name."

"Who?"

"That person is named Liu Bowen," Zhao Min said. "He indeed fell into the trap of a rebel leader, who was eventually given a position. I don't know that person's name. According to my father, Liu Bowen is a great military strategist, a very honest person, lives simply, and cannot be bribed."

Zhou Zhiruo said, "If you intended to invite him to join the Ming Jiao, it's useless to chase him. He's actually advising you to leave the Ming Jiao."

"How can I leave the Ming Jiao at a time like this?" Zhang Wuji murmured.

When they were celebrating the Lunar New Year in the city, news arrived that Zhang Shicheng's forces were attacking Suzhou.

"Hangzhou is on high alert," Fan Yao said. "Jiaozhu need not worry. Yin Yewang is coming with ten thousand men. Ming Jiao soldiers are not like ordinary soldiers. Their kung fu is higher. I have told them not to attack anyone, unless they attack Hangzhou."

Zhou Zhiruo snorted. "Hmph, Zhu Yuanzhang wouldn't dare attack Hangzhou! And besides, what's the point for him? What I'm thinking about is Zhang Shicheng; to this day, he refuses to interact with our side. We don't know what he'll do."

"Zhang Shicheng has always been generous to other salt merchants, which is why he has many allies," Fan Yao said. "Yin Tianzheng is quite eccentric, which is why he was never close with him. Yin Tianzheng doesn't like working under anyone else's command. In this regard, Zhang Shicheng is the same, which is why he won't contact us. After contacting us, wouldn't that mean he'd have to submit to Jiaozhu's command? But that doesn't mean he wants to attack us."

"I think sooner or later he will definitely attack us," Zhou Zhiruo said.

Zhou Zhiruo's words were later proven true. About a month after the Lunar New Year, Zhang Shicheng successfully occupied Suzhou. Simultaneously, Zhu Yuanzhang's forces marched towards Jiqing. The new Yuan army commander, Chen Zhaoxian[^chen-zhaoxian], was Chen Esen's nephew. In that battle, Chen Zhaoxian, along with approximately thirty-six thousand of his troops, surrendered to Zhu Yuanzhang. History records that in April 1356, Zhu Yuanzhang successfully marched into Jiqing. Zhu Yuanzhang immediately renamed the city Yingtian[^yingtian], meaning 'Responding to the Will of Heaven'. About two or three months later, in the summer, Zhang Shide — Zhang Shicheng's younger brother — attacked Hangzhou, but was successfully repelled. But next, Fang Guozhen gathered about a thousand naval fleets and established control over Shaoxing, Ningbo, Taizhou, Wenzhou, and Qingyuan.

[^chen-zhaoxian]: Chen Zhaoxian (陳兆先) is a historical figure.
[^yingtian]: Yingtian (應天 or 应天) in Mandarin means 'Responding to the Will of Heaven'. The modern name of this city is Nanjing.

Zhou Zhiruo shouted angrily, "Bastard! Didn't I tell you? Zhang Shicheng himself was indeed driven out of Hangzhou, but now Shaoxing is controlled by Fang Guozhen! You forgot to pay attention to the river in Hangzhou, which flows from Zhejiang to the coast. Fang Guozhen must have broken through there. Now they control a long stretch from Shaoxing to Qingyuan; isn't this equivalent to controlling the entire eastern coast? Zhang Shicheng himself occupied Suzhou, but by cooperating with Fang Guozhen, they now dominate the eastern region. In other words, Jiangnan now belongs to Zhang Shicheng!"

But Zhang Wuji's attention was on another matter. He asked, "Is Zhang Shide truly Zhang Shicheng's younger brother?"

"That's right," Fan Yao said. "His two other younger brothers also led troops — Zhang Shiyi and Zhang Shixin — but Zhang Shide was appointed as the supreme commander."

"Hmm!" Zhang Wuji said, thinking hard, then said, "In that case, tell Zhu Yuanzhang to keep a close watch on Zhang Shide. If there's an opportunity, capture him! Hasn't Han Lin'er already appointed Zhu Yuanzhang as the Governor of Jiangnan? That way we'll have a chance to talk to Zhang Shicheng without having to fight!"

"Brilliant idea!" Fan Yao said. "I'll send Hu Zhanglao to Hangzhou right now!"

Amidst the tension with Zhang Shicheng, they heard news that Toqto'a had died in Yunnan[^toqtoa-died], most likely poisoned by an assassin sent by Hama.

"Ah, what a pity," Zhao Min said sadly. Toqto'a was one of her admired politicians. "After this, the situation of the Yuan Dynasty will surely be very chaotic."

[^toqtoa-died]: On January 10, 1356, Toqto'a, who had been banished to Yunnan, died, allegedly poisoned by an assassin sent by Hama.
