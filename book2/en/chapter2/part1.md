# 1. Xiangyang, 1355
### *A Birthday Gift From the Empress*

A few days later, in Xiangyang, they celebrated Zhao Min's birthday according to the Gregorian calendar, which fell on the fifteenth of September that year. Zhou Zhiruo made birthday noodles for Zhao Min, then said, "Meizi, that means you can also celebrate your birthday according to our calendar in Zhongyuan, right?"

"Hmm, I suppose so," Zhao Min said. "But unfortunately, I've never calculated my birthday based on our calendar. My mother always remembered people's birthdays according to the Gregorian calendar, just like how she remembered Christmas. Unfortunately, I also don't know how to calculate it."

"I myself can only remember my birthday according to our calendar," Zhou Zhiruo said. "The tenth day of next month."

"The calculation is very complicated," Zhao Min said. "Let's just assume your birthday is the tenth day of the tenth month in the Gregorian calendar, since it's currently the ninth month. That way we can celebrate it every year on the same date — according to the Gregorian calendar."

Zhang Wuji sighed somewhat sadly. He said, "Unfortunately, I don't know when my birthday is at all. At that time, we were on Binghuo Dao. My parents and Yifu paid no attention to it whatsoever. I only know that this year I am twenty-four years old, according to our calendar. That's all my father and mother told me before they died. That's also all my martial uncles and Tai Shifu could remember." He then chuckled, adding, "But Min Mei is very lucky; her most special birthday gift was given by Empress Qi!"

"According to our calendar, a person is considered one year old when born, whereas according to the Gregorian calendar, a person is only one year old the following year," Zhao Min said. "That means you're only twenty-three years old in the Gregorian calendar. It's currently 1355, so you were born in 1332. Let's just say you were born on the tenth day of the sixth month, just so we can celebrate your birthday."

Zhang Wuji laughed, saying, "Why do you always choose the number ten?"

"Because it's an easy number to remember," Zhao Min replied.

The three of them still remembered the unexpected kindness from the group of blue-clad women in the Mongolian eatery some time ago. Although they didn't know who the woman was at the time, the gratitude for the free meal still lingered.

Zhao Min said with a light laugh, "The taste of the free bread from Huanghou still lingers on my tongue."

They laughed imagining the unexpected meeting. But inwardly, they actually wondered, what was the Huanghou's intention in paying for their meal, and even adding several types of food that were not insignificant in quantity?

Actually, in his heart, Zhang Wuji was thinking of something else, entirely beyond the girls' guesses. "It seems Zhang Daozhang's efforts have borne fruit, but where is he now? Is this just my imagination?"

Zhao Min then explained how to calculate days in the Gregorian calendar, and they then wrote down a calendar until the following year based on Zhao Min's explanations. This activity excited Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo, as they discovered a new way of looking at daily activities.

"Well, this means we can also celebrate New Year twice," Zhou Zhiruo said again. "According to this record, we will celebrate the New Year 1356 in about three months, and our New Year falls on the tenth day of the second month next year. This is magical to me!"

"Currently, we have something called the Shoushi calendar," Zhao Min said again. "The way we understand dating actually changed a bit after the Yuan Dynasty was established, specifically around 1281 CE. Right now, we consider a year to have 365 days. This is almost similar to the Gregorian calendar. But the Gregorian calendar has twenty-nine days in the second month every four years. This makes the calculation between the calendar we use now and the Gregorian calendar a bit difficult. To make matters worse, we always say something like, 'In the third year of the reign of Emperor So-and-so of That Dynasty, the second day, first month in This-and-That era,' which makes it even harder. Because these eras don't have the same reference point in every dynasty." She smiled, then turned to Zhang Wuji and said, "To make matters worse, like your birth year, there was a child emperor who reigned for only two months. You don't know what month you were born. It's possible you were born before he came to power. Well, let's say you were indeed born when he was reigning, then our way of referring to it would surely be 'In the first year of the Zhishun era, during the reign of Emperor Ningzong of Yuan, the second month, the third day, at So-and-so o'clock, Zhang Wuji was born' — and so on. Isn't that very difficult to state?"

Zhang Wuji burst into laughter, saying, "At that time, my parents wouldn't have known who was in power, let alone the era names and such? No wonder they couldn't state my birth date!"

"I'm luckier," Zhou Zhiruo said. "My father did mention the reign of Emperor Toghon Temur, Yuantong era, second year, eighth month, tenth day. But my father didn't remember the hour."

"Well, in that case, we should be able to calculate it based on your father's information," Zhao Min said. "Even this isn't too easy. As far as I know, Emperor Toghon Temur began his reign around 1333 CE, roughly a year after Wuji Gege was born. If it says the second year, then your birth year would be 1334. To calculate the month, we need to go backward, and that's quite complicated since it's been more than twenty years."

They each kept the results of that conversation in their hearts and pondered it daily, feeling that the calendar system was a very important thing, although they couldn't explain why. Zhao Min, who understood numbers and writing in Latin, also explained how to write numbers to Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo.

Within a few days, they managed to compile a combined calendar of the Gregorian and their current calendar on several sheets of paper, until the next New Year, according to the Gregorian calendar. At that time, only the three of them understood well what the writings on those sheets of paper meant. Each sheet contained the dates for a month.

"Wow!" Zhang Wuji exclaimed, amazed by their own work. "This looks great, but I wonder what use it is to us right now."

Zhao Min grinned widely, then said, "I don't know for sure either. But since Zhou Jiejie thinks it's important, and you also think it's important, and I myself enjoy researching such things, I joined in compiling it. We'll surely find a use for it later."

Besides tinkering with the calendar and practicing kung fu, they found no other interesting activities until the end of that year. They finally celebrated the Gregorian New Year 1356 for the first time, and felt it was very special, because meanwhile, only they themselves truly understood what they were celebrating.

About a month later, Shuobude reported from Hezhou that Zhang Shicheng was moving towards Suzhou. Soon after, Fan Yao arrived from Hangzhou with the same news. They immediately contacted Wu Zhanglao to prepare the Kai Pang members to spy on Zhang Shicheng's activities in Suzhou. Furthermore, Fan Yao also said that Fang Guozhen's territory on the eastern coast was expanding, making it difficult for Yin Yewang's naval fleet.

"This aligns with Chang Yuchun's prophecy," Zhao Min said. "I think the government will take action soon, so we probably don't need to fight Fang Guozhen ourselves."

"Such a thing is hard to tell Jiujiu," Zhang Wuji said. "She still hasn't found Zhu'er, and it seems rather difficult to talk to her, as she holds a grudge against you. Perhaps she thinks I lied when I said Zhu'er was still alive. If we tell her to do nothing, we'll be seen as talking nonsense, because we haven't personally experienced the difficulties she's having with Fang Guozhen."

"This is my fault," Zhou Zhiruo said. "I should be the one to talk."

"It's no use; she'll realize it herself when she meets Zhu'er in person," Zhang Wuji said.

"It's best if we pay attention to Hangzhou, because it's not impossible that Zhang Shicheng wants to conquer it," Fan Yao said. "Currently, Zhang Shicheng is already very rich from his salt monopoly. By conquering Suzhou, he will surely then want to control all of Jiangnan. Fang Guozhen already controls Ningbo, Taizhou, and Wenzhou. Doesn't that mean their group will soon control the entire eastern coast?"

"He doesn't want to submit to Han Lin'er and Liu Futong?" Zhang Wuji asked.

"No, he doesn't," Fan Yao replied.

When they arrived at Christmas Eve that year, Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo saw Zhao Min lost in thought by the window, and they felt surprised. Then Zhou Zhiruo asked, "Meizi, what's wrong? You're not yourself."

"Tomorrow is Christmas Day according to the Gregorian calendar," Zhao Min said. "Usually on Christmas Eve, my mother always invited us to pray, and there was a decorated pine tree at home. My father wasn't a Christian, but my mother would still invite everyone to celebrate it. Now, it's been two years in a row that I haven't seen my mother."

For Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo, who had lost both their parents since childhood, this was not surprising. They felt the same from time to time, but because they were accustomed to it, they rarely felt sad anymore. Zhou Zhiruo said, "Actually, you could still go see your mother right now. From here to Ruyang is not too far."

But Zhao Min hardened her heart and said, "No. I know why my father drove me out. If I were to see them now, I would cause trouble for my family. The Ming Jiao is considered rebels, and I have decided to join the Ming Jiao, so I must not see them again."

Zhang Wuji felt guilty and said, "Min Mei, actually you truly don't need to do this. I can understand, and I won't blame you if you go home now."

"What do you take me for?" Zhao Min said, offended. "I can understand why you rebel, and that's why I genuinely want to do it too. The laws of this Yuan Dynasty are indeed biased in many ways. People are grouped into several castes, and the highest caste is the Mongolians. Unfortunately, if a Mongolian acts arbitrarily towards the Han tribe, they will be tried in a separate court, and usually easily acquitted. Meanwhile, if it's a Han person doing it, they are also tried by yet another court, and generally given harsh punishments. Precisely because of things like that, I then felt that those who oppressed the people should be directly eliminated, no need for trials, because it's useless — they would be acquitted anyway."

Zhou Zhiruo did not understand what Zhao Min was saying at all, but Zhang Wuji had heard about the Yuan Dynasty's laws concerning that matter, so he immediately understood. Zhou Zhiruo asked, "What are the other three castes?"

"The second is Semuren[^semuren], the third is Hanren[^hanren], and the last — the lowest — is Nanren[^nanren]," Zhao Min said. "You must have heard people mention these terms to some extent. Don't think you are 'Hanren.' The 'Hanren' here refers to the descendants of the Jin tribe, people from Goryeo, or people from Yunnan of the Dali Kingdom. Thus, it is precisely you who are considered 'Nanren,' and that's just the polite term."

[^semuren]: Semuren (色目人): Or 'People of Various Categories,' the second caste in the social structure established by Kublai Khan. Citizens of West and Central Asian descent were generally included in this group.
[^hanren]: Hanren (漢人): Or 'Han People,' refers to all citizens descended from the Jin Dynasty, people from Goryeo, or citizens from the Dali Kingdom.
[^nanren]: Nanren (南人): Or 'Southerners,' referring to the true Han Chinese. They were also commonly called 'Nanman' (南蠻) or even 'Manzi' (蠻子), meaning 'Barbarians.'

"Why did Kublai Khan issue such regulations?" Zhou Zhiruo asked.

Zhang Wuji had heard about this from Zhang Sanfeng. He said, "Not long after Yang Guo killed Mongke Khan, Kublai Khan fought against his own biological brother — Ariq Boke — who declared himself Great Khan in Karakorum. Because of this, Kublai then sought to become Emperor in the southern region. At that time, he was indeed already king in the area formerly occupied by the Jin Dynasty. He then financed Li Tan, a general from Shandong, to fight against the Song Dynasty there. But then this Li Tan defected and sided with the Song Dynasty. Kublai finally sent his general, who was also of Han descent, Shi Tianze, to fight Li Tan. At that time, Li Tan had become Kublai's trusted man; even his father-in-law held an important position in Kublai's government. They were all eventually executed. Li Tan himself died horribly, trampled by horses. From that moment on, Kublai Khan began to suspect Han citizens who suddenly became the center of attention on the political stage, and considered them dangerous. He began to forbid the granting of land and high military positions to Han citizens. Finally, Kublai became busy separating everyone based on their ethnicity, even down to how people dressed, so that they could all be easily distinguished. Tai Shifu told me this."

"Hmm, this is indeed true," Zhao Min said. "But previously, the regulations weren't like they are now. The wrong would still be wrong, and punished. Now, a Mongolian who is at fault can be freely acquitted, by simply paying a sum of money. That regulation slowly shifted after Kublai Khan died, due to power struggles among the upper echelons. Mongolian officials, of course, wanted to win against their Han rivals, so they exploited this legal loophole. Kublai himself never intended for it to become like this. Kublai also made mistakes in the past, believing that his own son — Zhenjin — conspired with the Han tribe against him, but he eventually found that it was the result of Ahmad Fanakati's schemes. Zhenjin eventually died in despair, before Kublai himself. Kublai deeply regretted this event, especially after he finally discovered that Ahmad Fanakati was very corrupt and exploited the trust of Kublai's empress — Chabi. There are many things here that I still don't understand, and everything is not as simple as we can imagine."

Fan Yao, who had just joined them, said, "Junzhu, there's something here that I truly cannot understand. We once saw the Governor of Henan — General Bayan — and in my opinion, he was an upright person. But then he was removed from his post. What exactly happened?"

Zhao Min laughed and said, "Shifu, at that time I wasn't even born yet. If Shifu doesn't know, how can I know? Regarding this, only the Emperor and the Huanghou understand it best. General Bayan's removal, as far as I know, was indeed a result of their schemes. But I know for sure, although General Bayan was a very upright person regarding the law, he was also very strange. He once issued an order to kill every Han citizen surnamed Zhao, Li, Wang, Zhou, Zhang, and several other common surnames. Isn't that utterly outrageous?"[^bayan]

[^bayan]: This issue is cited from the [Wikipedia article on Bayan of the Merkid.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayan_of_the_Merkid#Life)

"That's precisely what I can't understand," Fan Yao said. "What I saw in Henan at that time, General Bayan was not like that. He was very friendly with Han officials."

"Perhaps," Zhao Min said. "But General Bayan wasn't like my father. He was friendly with the Han tribe, but he opposed Mongolians following Han customs, and vice versa. In short, he opposed the mixing of customs. It seems he also opposed mixed marriages."

Zhang Wuji chuckled, then said, "Doesn't that list mean all of us — except Fan Youshi — would be executed? I guess General Bayan's political rivals were indeed surnamed Zhao, Zhou, Zhang, and also Wang. He was just looking for an excuse to kill them."

"Well, Shifu, if you truly admire General Bayan so much, his nephew — Toqto'a — was removed from his post by the Emperor earlier this year, even though he was winning in Gaoyou against Zhang Shicheng," Zhao Min said, laughing. "Actually, that Yellow River project was also Toqto'a's big idea, and I don't think it was a bad one. It did ultimately cause dissatisfaction among the common people, but what else could be done? If everyone asked for more pay, the work would never be finished, and we would still experience another great flood. These two matters are still very mysterious to me. Now Toqto'a is exiled to Yunnan."

They finally celebrated the New Year according to the Gregorian calendar. Zhang Wuji, feeling bored, wanted to walk around the city. The four of them ended up eating at an eatery near the Han River, not far from where Zhang Wuji first met Zhou Zhiruo when they were children. While having dinner, Zhang Wuji recounted the event to Fan Yao and Zhao Min, who listened attentively, without interrupting. After his story was finished, Fan Yao said, "I must admit, Chang Yuchun was very strong at only fourteen years old at that time. That Zhou Ziwang was indeed the first to declare himself emperor. I never thought his son would die at the hands of the imperial Tibetan monks. Indeed, at that time, Tibetan monks held great power in the palace."

"Still do, even now," Zhao Min said. "The current one is Hama. Toqto'a was allied with Hama initially, but Hama eventually betrayed him, causing Toqto'a to lose his position, and now he's exiled to Yunnan."

"Oh, so the story is that complicated!" Zhang Wuji said. "I thought Huang Shang or Huanghou had the right to demote someone."

"Huh? You think Huang Shang can just do that whenever he wants?" Zhao Min said. "I'm still wondering why Huang Shang expelled Toqto'a; to me, it makes no sense. All of that was Hama's 'suggestion.' But what is called a 'suggestion' is usually a compulsion, which Huang Shang inevitably has to follow. If the Grand Council all shouts in agreement, then Huang Shang can't do anything."

Zhou Zhiruo was lost in thought, muttering about an entirely different matter, "If only time could have stopped when we met at the Han River, everything would have been so different."
