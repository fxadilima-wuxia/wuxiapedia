# Chapter 2: Xiangyang, 1355
### *A Small Incident in a Legendary City*

After descending from the Wudang mountains, the first place that came to mind was Xiangyang. It was in this city that the legendary martial arts couple, often spoken of by people and also by Zhang Sanfeng, had fiercely defended its fortress. Tales of Guo Jing and Huang Rong's heroism still resonated to this day. They themselves had recently been involved in events related to the couple's creations—Yitian Jian and Tulong Dao!

"I'm getting excited!" Zhao Min said with a bright face. Her snow-white complexion seemed alive, a faint pink flush clearly indicating her rising spirits under the mild afternoon sun. She appeared lively, like other teenagers her age, just beginning to blossom. "This city could be called the origin of Yitian Jian and Tulong Dao! The legendary weapons that have just claimed so many lives!"

Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo watched her antics with a smile. They thought, "No matter how clever this child is, she's still a child. This city is indeed legendary, but it looks like an ordinary city, no different from other cities in Zhongyuan. Not everyone here knows about Yitian Jian and Tulong Dao."

Zhao Min rode ahead of them, entering Xiangyang's sturdy and bustling city gate. This was not surprising, as Xiangyang was the gateway to the southern region of the province after crossing the Han River. At that moment, Zhou Zhiruo's memory was actually more fixed on the Han River than the city itself, because for her, that was where she first met Zhang Wuji, when they were twelve and ten years old respectively. She thought, laughing inwardly, "At that time, this little girl was just born."

They dismounted and strolled around the market, looking at the entertainment venues, which seemed lively even though it was still broad daylight. Usually, these places were crowded at night.

Zhang Wuji asked, "Are you hungry? I want to find something to eat, just to tide us over before dinner."

Zhou Zhiruo shook her head with a smile and said, "I'm not hungry, but I'll still accompany you both."

"I'm hungry!" Zhao Min exclaimed. "Let's find some good food."

Neither Zhang Wuji nor Zhou Zhiruo were surprised. Zhao Min was currently in her growth phase, and she seemed to need more food than other girls her age, considering her diligent martial arts training.

As they were still searching for a modest yet appealing eatery, their attention was drawn to a small commotion between a shop owner and a group of people. The trio approached the shop to see what was happening.

Upon getting closer, they found that the shop sold typical Mongolian food, and judging by their features, the people arguing with the owner also had Mongolian characteristics. This was quite interesting to them.

They heard the shop owner say, "Guanye[^guanye], to my humble knowledge, there's no rule stating that a shop like this cannot serve Han customers. I am merely a merchant; naturally, more customers mean more profit."

"Then you'll surely lose money," one of the soldiers retorted. "Because we won't eat here if you don't drive those people out!"

[^guanye]: Guānyé (官爷): A deferential term used when addressing soldiers or low-ranking officials.

The shop owner bowed respectfully, still smiling, and said, "Guanye, please find another place that suits your taste."

With a snort, the soldiers then left to find another establishment.

Such a scene was not particularly strange to them, but at that moment, Zhang Wuji was carefully observing the shop owner's appearance. He felt he couldn't determine whether this person was Mongolian or Han. There was a regulation requiring Han people to wear their own distinct clothing, as did those from the Hui tribe or others, although such regulations were often ignored because, of course, officials or local governments couldn't possibly scrutinize the clothes worn by so many people daily. But the shop owner cleverly wore clothing that had no specific distinguishing features. He also spoke Mongolian fluently when talking to other customers, though he had used a lot of Han language earlier. Nowadays, ordinary Mongolians were also accustomed to speaking Han, and they couldn't be distinguished from others, a clear example being Zhao Min. Nevertheless, Zhang Wuji found this shop owner very intriguing. He became curious about what the Han people eating inside the shop looked like.

Zhang Wuji said, reaching into his pocket, "I suddenly want to eat there."

The two girls beside him looked surprised. Zhou Zhiruo asked, "Why?"

"Just curious," Zhang Wuji replied simply. "I think my money can still cover the cost of food here."

Zhao Min had just sold all the luxurious jewelry she brought, and she also still had a considerable supply of gold ingots to fund their journey. She knew Zhang Wuji didn't carry much money, so she said, "This time, let me pay. Let's go in!"

Upon entering the seemingly luxurious large tent, she immediately scanned the room to see who the soldiers meant by 'those people'. As they sat down at a table prepared for them, her gaze suddenly fixed on a group of people calmly eating a few tables away. The four men were well-built, clearly indicating their martial arts skills were not to be underestimated. And the most interesting person was the fifth, who turned out to be a woman. The woman appeared middle-aged, though not yet fifty. She wore clothes like a female martial artist, blue in color, and before her lay a long sword.

"Ah, so those are the ones the soldiers meant," Zhang Wuji thought.

Suddenly, Zhao Min whispered, "Huanghou[^huanghou]."

[^huanghou]: Huanghou (皇后): The formal term for Empress.

Zhou Zhiruo and Zhang Wuji immediately turned to her in surprise. They subtly glanced towards the table Zhao Min indicated with her eyes, and indeed, it was the table occupied by the five people Zhang Wuji had just noticed. He was greatly shocked.

Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo had seen two Yuan Dynasty Empresses before, when they visited Dadu and coincidentally there was an Imperial Festival where Zhao Min deliberately staged a puppet show to mock Zhou Zhiruo. But the woman they saw now looked very different. They could, of course, surmise that this woman must be Empress Qi, if Zhao Min was correct. But neither of them could recognize her in this attire.

Under the table, they felt Zhao Min's small hand signaling them not to stare at the table for too long, as it would surely arouse suspicion. Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo immediately understood. They saw a waiter approach with a friendly smile, asking for their order.

Given their shallow knowledge of Mongolian food and drink names, Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo let Zhao Min order whatever she deemed suitable.

Zhao Min ordered Mongolian-style flatbread, along with meat and airag for them to share. While the waiter went to prepare their order, Zhang Wuji secretly glanced at the table. His gaze met that of the woman Zhao Min had identified as Empress Qi, and the woman smiled kindly at him. Feeling a little embarrassed, Zhang Wuji returned a slight smile in greeting.

In his heart, he thought, "After she smiled, she looked more like the Empress Qi I saw back then."

The woman in blue seemed to be whispering to one of her companions, and after that, the man rose from his seat and walked towards a group of waiters waiting near the cashier. He said something in a low tone that they couldn't clearly hear from their table. The waiters nodded earnestly, then one of them immediately walked towards a door that seemed to lead to the kitchen.

About ten minutes later, their order arrived. Two cheerful waiters placed all the food from their trays onto their table. Three flatbreads and meat, then airag. But when the other waiter was about to place the contents of his tray, Zhou Zhiruo said, "Oh, we only ordered this. That doesn't seem to be our order."

The waiter said kindly, "You three are very lucky. All this food is free; it's a gift from our shop."

"Wow," Zhang Wuji said, surprised. He was about to say something, but the two waiters turned and quickly left.

The contents of the second waiter's tray seemed much more substantial than their own order. There were three large cups of goat milk, various types of small snacks, and fresh fruits.

Zhao Min immediately and unhesitatingly filled the center of her bread with a generous amount of meat, then began to eat with relish, oblivious to those around them. Zhang Wuji, feeling hungry, also followed the girl, starting with a little goat milk before him, then busying himself with the flatbread. They quickly finished the bread without a trace, then began to eye the small snacks, most of which also resembled small breads, likely filled with meat or other ingredients.

Unlike Zhang Wuji, who was tall and muscular, and Zhao Min, who was in her growth phase, Zhou Zhiruo had a small build, and she didn't feel the need for so much food, besides not feeling hungry yet. When she bit into the bread, she felt a sensation she had never experienced before. It had a very distinct aroma, slightly meaty even without any filling. But she still felt she had to struggle a bit to finish the large bread.

She watched Zhang Wuji and Zhao Min eat ravenously and quickly. In less than fifteen minutes, all the food and drink on the table were gone, mostly consumed by the two of them.

Unconsciously, her eyes glanced towards the table where the woman Zhao Min had identified as Empress Qi was sitting with four men, seemingly her personal guards. It turned out the woman was also looking at her intently. She almost lost her composure when she saw the woman smile kindly at her. "Perhaps I misread," she thought. But it was very real. For some reason, she then returned what she judged to be a greeting, also with a smile.

Soon after, they saw the woman stand up, say something in a low tone to her four guards, and they walked towards the cashier, then left the shop.

Feeling full, and seeing that Zhou Zhiruo's bread and milk were also finished, Zhao Min waved to a waiter.

"How much do we owe?" she asked.

The waiter smiled and said, "Everything has been paid for, Xiaojie[^xiaojie] doesn't need to pay anymore."

[^xiaojie]: Xiaojie (小姐): A respectful term for a young lady.

"Huh? Who paid?"

"The group that just left," the waiter said.
