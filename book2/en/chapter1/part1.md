# Chapter 1
## Songshan, 1355: Alpha and Omega

The war between them and the Yuan Dynasty soldiers had passed. The fierce battle among the Wulin heroes in their effort to *kill the golden lion* had also passed. The lion in question, Xie Xun, had now also become a monk in Shaolin. Zhou Zhiruo's attempt to silence him had also failed, even in a most humiliating way; she was completely stripped bare by the Yellow-Robed Maiden.

Now, Zhou Zhiruo's problem with Yin Li, whom she had 'killed' on Snake Island, had also miraculously and thankfully passed. It turned out Yin Li was still alive, though she had become insane. It was truly a relief for Zhou Zhiruo, who had genuinely regretted her actions. Conversely, it was somewhat disappointing for Zhao Min, because doesn't that mean Zhou Zhiruo is *no longer guilty*? After all, Zhou Zhiruo and Zhang Wuji had already been engaged! So what would her fate be now, would Zhang Wuji want to return to his beautiful fiancée?

At that time, Zhang Wuji was only distressed because he felt Zhou Zhiruo had killed his younger cousin, Yin Li, but now it turned out Yin Li was not dead.

In her heart, Zhao Min cheered, "Don't I still have a third request? I will definitely use it if he dares to discard me!" But then she thought again, "Doesn't Zhou Zhiruo also hold the same promise from Zhang Wuji, which she will clearly use at the right moment? Damn, there's always something wrong! Yin Li is gone, one rival less, but now there's this snag... In short, it seems all of Zhou Zhiruo's cruel actions and all her other mistakes are not getting worse now. Even though Song Qingshu truly killed Mo Shenggu because of her, that was Song Qingshu's own fault; Zhou Zhiruo didn't even know about it at all. And certainly did not conspire in that accident."

She saw Zhou Zhiruo stand up, saying coldly, "Let's go!"

"Where to?" asked Zhao Min.

Zhou Zhiruo replied, "Earlier in Shaolin, I saw Zhang Zhong rushing to find him," she gestured with her head towards Zhang Wuji, "It seems something very important has happened within the Ming Cult."

Zhao Min smiled at Zhang Wuji and said in a comforting tone, "Yin Li has gone, pursuing the Prince from the Wonderland in her mind. But there's still me and Zhou Jiejie, who will accompany you to build your own Wonderland."

Zhou Zhiruo glared sharply at her, then snorted and asked, "What do you mean by that?"

"Nothing," Zhao Min answered lightly. "People say I brag a lot, my words are nonsense, so just ignore it."

Zhang Wuji's heart turned cold. "I must not neglect *Ming Jiao* affairs for women," he thought, then quickly said, "Let's quickly find out what happened!"

On their journey to the Ming Cult camp, a million thoughts swirled in Zhang Wuji's mind. They had personally experienced warfare, though brief, it had been incredibly tense, and he had led that war. Everyone was now praising him. He wondered why, in his heart, he felt no pride, which he should have. Instead, there were only lines from Chaghan Temur, whom he had seemingly just defeated—

At this point, he suddenly thought, something was wrong here; *their victory felt a little too easy*. He couldn't explain why he was thinking this. Had Chaghan truly given way on purpose?

He remembered his words again, "*I myself would rather die by your hand than have to kill you*..."

He was very surprised to realize his own thoughts. At that time, he had indeed been touched by Chaghan's explanation, but for some reason, he had never taken it too seriously. Besides, Zhao Min, no matter how beautiful and kind she was, was still just a little girl, no more than thirteen years old! Could Chaghan truly believe that he — Zhang Wuji — would marry Zhao Min?

But then he remembered Chaghan Temur's earlier words again, "My ancestors came from the Naiman tribe... you want to drive me from my own homeland...?"

In his heart, he pondered, this meant that compared to Chaghan Temur, *he was truly not a native of Zhongyuan*, even though both his parents were from here. Such a stark contrast compared to Chaghan Temur himself.

While daydreaming and walking quickly, he felt his left hand gently held by Zhao Min, without her saying anything. Perhaps the little girl already knew he was lost in thought. He turned to her with a faint smile, without saying anything.

Suddenly, they saw a crowd of villagers busily discussing some news, and it seemed to be very serious news. Some of them clenched their fists in the air and shouted. Their ears caught a name that sounded very familiar: 'Han Shantong'.

Zhang Wuji invited the two girls to stop for a moment and listen carefully from a distance.

"He's dead!" said one of the farmers. "Immediately executed as soon as he was captured!"

"Where did you hear that?" asked another.

"I just heard it, about Han Shantong, that is," replied the first person. "I was actually busy looking for news after hearing about Han Lin'er's enthronement as Emperor! Think about it, how could his son ascend the throne if Han Shantong was still alive?"

It was clear that his words were immediately accepted by everyone, as they made sense.

"Then where did you hear the news of Han Lin'er's enthronement itself?" asked another person who was still unconvinced.

"You can see the announcement in the village hall, if you still don't believe it," the farmer replied again. "About this, I heard it directly from our Village Head. Do you think he's lying? If you ask where he heard it from, I don't know."

At this point, Zhang Wuji immediately urged the two girls to quicken their pace towards the Ming Cult camp.

"That must be true," he said.

Upon arriving at the camp, they were immediately greeted by Zhang Zhong and Fan Yao. But Zhang Wuji immediately asked, "The news about Han Shantong and Han Lin'er — is it true?"

The expressions on both men's faces immediately changed drastically. Fan Yao said, "We were all too busy with the Shaolin affair, so no one heard about Han Shantong's capture. We also only just heard about Han Lin'er's enthronement."

Zhang Wuji sighed deeply, sadly. Han Shantong was a leader he greatly respected. But as he was about to ask something, Fan Yao spoke again, "Jiaozhu, just now there was news that one of the leaders of the Red Turban Rebellion, Guo Zixing, has passed away. Shall we attend to pay our last respects? His body is currently in Chuzhou."

"Isn't Guo Zixing a good friend of Peng Dashi? We will definitely go," replied Zhang Wuji, for a moment forgetting about Han Shantong and Han Lin'er.

Fan Yao smiled, then added, "Not only is he Peng Yingyu's good friend, he is also Zhu Yuanzhang's father-in-law. And at this moment, Zhu Yuanzhang is awaiting the birth of his first child."

Zhang Wuji was surprised, and at the same time delighted. He laughed and said, "That's incredible! So Zhu Dage is Guo Zixing's son-in-law? When did he get married?"

"Guo Zixing has an adopted daughter named Ma Xiuying; she is the one who married Zhu Yuanzhang," Fan Yao replied.

"How interesting," Zhao Min interjected. "Does this mean all of Guo Zixing's forces now fall into Zhu Yuanzhang's hands?"

Fan Yao sensed a faint cynical tone in her voice. He smiled and said, "Junzhu is right."

"Doesn't Guo Zixing have sons?" asked Zhang Wuji.

"He does, their names are Guo Tianxu and Guo Tianyou," Fan Yao answered, scratching his head. "Hmm, it seems those two have a bit of a problem with Zhu Yuanzhang. Indeed, this leadership issue must be decided directly by Han Lin'er, or more precisely, Liu Futong."

"Isn't...?" Zhang Wuji began, but then he quickly realized what the problem was.

By inviting Zhang Wuji to attend Guo Zixing's funeral ceremony, Fan Yao subtly implied that there was an internal conflict within that family, and hoped that Zhang Wuji would help resolve it. Zhao Min had guessed the problem from the start. Zhang Wuji seemed to recall something. He approached Zhang Zhong and asked in a somewhat mysterious tone, "Zhang Daozhang, do you have any other news for me?"

Without waiting for Zhang Zhong's answer, he hurriedly pulled the Taoist priest's sleeve to move a few steps away, and the others only saw them whispering without being able to hear what they were discussing.

After listening carefully, Zhang Wuji seemed satisfied, then patted Zhang Zhong's shoulder with a beaming face, then said a few more words, and they only managed to hear, "No, this time you still have to do it yourself... Shuobude Dashi still has something else to take care of."

Hearing his name mentioned, Shuobude exchanged glances with Fan Yao, raising both hands in a gesture of not understanding. Zhao Min's and Zhou Zhiruo's brows furrowed slightly, a sign they were thinking hard, trying to guess.

But then they saw Zhang Zhong immediately depart, only waving from afar to say goodbye.

Actually, since their arrival, all the high-ranking Ming Cult officials had been surprised to see Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo with Zhang Wuji, but they dared not say anything. The two girls, quite different in age, seemed to get along well and were friendly with each other, even though previously they had fought fiercely for Zhang Wuji's love. In their hearts, they thought, "How did the Cult Leader reconcile these two tigresses?"

Zhou Zhiruo seemed uncomfortable with the gaze of all the Ming Cult officials; she immediately took Zhao Min's hand and said, "*Meizi*[^meizi], let's sit over there and wait!"

[^meizi]: Meizi (妹子): "Little Sister," a term of endearment for a younger female.

The two then sat side by side, chatting and joking on a large mountain rock, somewhat away from the high-ranking Ming Cult officials.

Zhang Wuji returned to his original spot with light steps. His face seemed satisfied and beaming, saying lightly, "Alright, let's quickly depart for Chuzhou to meet Guo Zixing's family."

Zhao Min rejoined them, but this time she seemed to be alone. Zhou Zhiruo had apparently quietly disappeared without a trace. "Wuji *Gege*[^gege]," she said. "Zhou *Jiejie*[^jiejie] just said she didn't want to wait for you. She has an important matter to resolve, but didn't explain what it was."

[^gege]: Gege (哥哥): "Elder Brother".
[^jiejie]: Jiejie (姐姐): "Elder sister".

Zhang Wuji seemed somewhat disappointed to hear that, but then he smiled again and said, "It's alright, that's good too. The Emei School disciples have been waiting for her anyway. We should leave now."

That very day, Fan Yao, Shuobude, Zhang Wuji, and Zhao Min departed for Chuzhou. Along the way, Fan Yao and Shuobude recounted that Guo Tianxu and Guo Tianyou had always been hostile towards Zhu Yuanzhang from the beginning, and always wanted to kill him. They feared Zhu Yuanzhang's military power would become stronger than theirs, and then turn against them. Before this, Guo Zixing had successfully taken Haozhou, but because he constantly clashed with Sun Deya, he was eventually forced to leave Haozhou and move to Chuzhou, which had been taken by Zhu Yuanzhang.

Guo Zixing had indeed saved Zhu Yuanzhang's life before Zhu Yuanzhang joined the Red Turban Army. At that time, Zhu Yuanzhang, dressed as a monk, seemed very suspicious to the city guards in Haozhou, but in Guo Zixing's eyes, his appearance was very impressive. He told the guards who had captured Zhu Yuanzhang to immediately release him and allow him to join the Red Turban fighters he led. At that time, Zhu Yuanzhang's fighting spirit greatly impressed Guo Zixing, and he later married his adopted daughter, Ma Xiuying, to Zhu Yuanzhang.

"So Zhu *Dage*[^dage] was no longer a monk at that time?" Zhang Wuji asked.

[^dage]: Dage (大哥): "Big Brother".

Zhao Min laughed heartily. "Becoming Guo Zixing's son-in-law is certainly more appealing than being a monk," she said.

"Guo Zixing was indeed a formidable leader at that time," Shuobude said. "But he wasn't the only leader of the Red Turban Army; there were many other leaders stronger than him. But in any case, after that, Zhu Yuanzhang always followed wherever Guo Zixing went. He was the first to realize that Sun Deya intended to go against Guo Zixing, and he informed his father-in-law about it. But unfortunately, Guo Zixing didn't listen to his advice."

"What happened?" Zhang Wuji asked, curious.

"Sun Deya captured Guo Zixing," Shuobude said. "That's when Guo Zixing finally realized that Zhu Yuanzhang was right. Next, Zhu Yuanzhang successfully rescued Peng Da and Guo Zixing. Unexpectedly, Guo Zixing then wanted revenge and captured Sun Deya, but at that time Zhu Yuanzhang was captured by Sun Deya's subordinates. Therefore, Guo Zixing was eventually forced to exchange Sun Deya to free Zhu Yuanzhang, and this left him dissatisfied. He even began to feel mistaken in supporting Zhu Yuanzhang. Several times he wanted to attack Zhu Yuanzhang, but then canceled his intention. This made him feel wavering and very stressed. One could say he died from mental pressure."

"A big advantage for Zhu Yuanzhang," Zhao Min said again, eating the peanuts she shelled, discarding the husks to the side of the road, laughing coldly, before continuing, "I guess every day he deliberately acted insolently, giving his father-in-law more mental pressure."

The journey from Henan to Chuzhou was not too long; they arrived in a few days. On the first day, Zhang Wuji and Zhao Min, who had not had time to rest previously, took two hours to sleep at the inn after lunch, then they quickly continued their journey.

Upon arriving in Chuzhou, they found three coffins in the mourning hall. From the guests, they heard that Guo Zixing's two sons had just died in battle with Yuan forces led by a traitor, Chen Yexian. But they had managed to defeat the Yuan forces in that battle.

Zhao Min whispered to the other three, "We arrived late."

The four of them didn't speak much with Zhu Yuanzhang and his family, given the mournful atmosphere, and at that time, there were many visitors. Guo Zixing's family was highly respected there. After paying their last respects to the three deceased in front of the coffins, they quickly departed from the house, heading to an inn to rest for a moment.

"Where is this Chen Yexian now?" Zhang Wuji asked as they walked out.

Shuobude shook his head, sighing. "He's dead," he said. "It's unknown who killed him. His body was found in the bushes, outside Haozhou. A guest just told me about it."

Zhang Wuji, glancing at Zhao Min, saw that the corners of her lips seemed to be smiling, but she wasn't actually smiling. He immediately asked, "Who was this Chen Yexian originally under the command of?"

"About this, does it need to be asked again?" Zhao Min said as she stepped into the inn, without intending to explain the sentence.

The inn was quite busy. Since Zhao Min and Zhang Wuji had lacked sleep the previous night, they felt quite tired now. They ordered a good amount of food to combat their fatigue. Seeing the two young people eating heartily, Fan Yao and Shuobude laughed. Fan Yao noticed that in recent years, Zhao Min had grown taller and appeared more athletic. She was not yet fourteen years old at this time. Her age difference compared to Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo was quite significant. But because she was accustomed to leading many people at a very young age, this age difference was often obscured, plus her tall stature contributed to the impression that she was more mature than her actual age. Only if one observed from a very close distance would they realize that Zhao Min was actually still young.

Near their table, there were some people who also seemed to have just returned from Guo Zixing's residence. They were all young men who had recently joined Guo Zixing's army. Because their conversation was quite loud, Zhang Wuji and the others could hear it clearly.

"Alas, who would have thought that scoundrel surnamed Chen finally managed to kill Young Master Guo," said one plump, round-faced man. "But in the end, we still won; that scoundrel died."

"That's right, fortunately, Commander Zhu was vigilant; he had intended to kill Commander Zhu before," said his smaller companion, with a large mole near his nose.

*Use "Junzhu" instead of "Princess", as Zhao Min is not a real "Princess" by inheritance. Unlike Jin Yong's story, we use the real Chaghan Temur, who is not a "Wangye", he did not have royal inherintance! The title "Junzhu" in this case was given directly by the emperor since Zhao Min was very little, that's why here father has to manage the territory for her, before she can do it herself. Chaghan Temur was a Naiman origin, how can he become a "Wangye"? Likewise, never use "Cult Leader" to address Zhang Wuji, as it look strange, use "Jiaozhu" directly instead:*

Zhang Wuji and his three companions exchanged glances. After the young men left the inn, Fan Yao said, "Junzhu's guess was truly spot-on!" [^junzhu]

[^junzhu]: In the Yuan Dynasty, the title Junzhu (郡主) designated a county princess, a specific rank within the imperial family's female nobility. It was a title lower than Gu 公主 (Grand Princess) but higher than Xianzhu (县主), a county-level princess. The title Junzhu was typically conferred upon daughters of princes or other high-ranking members of the imperial clan. But, in this case, Zhao Min's "Shaomin Junzhu" title was bethowed directly by Emperor Toghon Temur, not inherited from her father. Chaghan Temur was only manage her territory for her, before she can do it herself.

Zhang Wuji stared at Zhao Min intently, surprised. "How did you know this was Zhu Yuanzhang's scheme?"

Zhao Min laughed and said, "Zhang *Jiaozhu*[^jiaozhu] still doesn't understand the human heart. Do you think Zhu Yuanzhang is as kind as you? Here, no one feels there's animosity between Zhu Yuanzhang and his two brothers-in-law. This means that Zhu Yuanzhang deliberately did not act hostile towards them, even though Guo Tianyou and Guo Tianxu clearly always intended to get rid of him. If next time you find that one of them falls in love with Ma Xiuying, don't be surprised."

[^jiaozhu]: Jiaozhu (教主): "The head or founder of religious sect". This term can be translated as "Grandmaster" or just "Master".

"This... what does it have to do with...?" Zhang Wuji asked.

Zhao Min clicked her tongue impatiently. "Guo Tianxu and Guo Tianyou clearly always wanted to eliminate Zhu Yuanzhang out of jealousy. After Zhu Yuanzhang's appearance, Guo Zixing gave him full support, and even married his adopted daughter to Zhu Yuanzhang. If you are always around people who want to kill you, can you truly be good to them? All that is, of course, just pretense. As soon as there's an opportunity, Zhu Yuanzhang will, of course, immediately get rid of them."

"And that opportunity was...?"

"That opportunity was Chen Yexian defecting to their side!"

Zhang Wuji was surprised. "Wasn't Chen Yexian defecting to the government side?"

Zhao Min shook her head. "If government people defect to the rebel side, lately we'd surely hear about it often. But someone from Guo Zixing's side defecting to the government side, I'm sure that kind of thing is very rare. Specifically, this Chen Yexian was originally from the Yuan Dynasty, and defected to Guo Zixing's side with the aim of spying on them, but apparently Zhu Yuanzhang sniffed out his intention, which is why he intended to kill Zhu Yuanzhang, but failed. Zhu Yuanzhang then saw this as an opportunity to get rid of the Guo brothers, and deliberately left Chen Yexian there without exposing his cover. As soon as there was an attack from the Yuan Dynasty, he seized that opportunity. It's clear that Guo Tianxu and Guo Tianyou led the troops, and when they were cornered, Zhu Yuanzhang remained silent. After the two men died, only then did he eliminate Chen Yexian and lead his army to win the war. That way, people only saw Guo Tianxu and Guo Tianyou die on the battlefield, and not because of a personal dispute with Zhu Yuanzhang."

Shuobude and Zhang Wuji were stunned by the explanation, but Fan Yao had understood it all along.

Zhang Wuji said, "I must marry you immediately to recruit all your father's soldiers."

Zhao Min chuckled and said, "Are you sure you can do that? My father certainly wouldn't allow it; the proof is he even chased me away! Right now, only *I* can marry you immediately to take over all Ming Jiao members from your hands. Believe me, you won't be able to defeat me."

Fan Yao laughed heartily at the scene. This dangerous joke could make everyone who had suspected Zhao Min from the beginning even more suspicious, but it was delivered casually and at the same time with a very elegant style.

"We must admonish Zhu Yuanzhang," Zhang Wuji said. "Why haven't I seen Chang Yuchun and Xu Da since earlier?"

Zhao Min smiled. "People like Chang Yuchun and Xu Da," she said, "must be annoyed seeing Zhu Yuanzhang's charade. That's why they kept far away so they wouldn't hear Zhu Yuanzhang's cries."

In his heart, Zhang Wuji laughed. He still remembered how hard Zhu Yuanzhang cried in front of the coffins of Guo Zixing, Guo Tianxu, and Guo Tianyou earlier. Xu Da and Chang Yuchun were honest people who always spoke frankly; they didn't like such fake courtesies, so it made perfect sense that they intentionally stayed away.

Shuobude said, "Jiaozhu, perhaps we should immediately send someone to inform Liu Futong about this development, so he can decide who will lead Guo Zixing's army next."

At that moment, Zhou Zhiruo suddenly appeared in the inn and went directly to their table, stood for a second near the door, listening to their conversation, before approching, "I don't think that's necessary; I've investigated this matter along the way, and my conclusion is the same." She said, "With Zhang Jiaozhu here, *why do you need to report to Liu Futong*?"

"Miss Zhou!" Fan Yao and Shuobude greeted, somewhat surprised to see her appearance.

---

*Finally, since this is an early chapter, fix the oher terminologies commonly used:*

"Just now, I saw Zhu Yuanzhang call Xu Da and Chang Yuchun to speak privately. I think he's already read your plans, so you'd better act fast," Zhou Zhiruo continued. "I've also sent some male Emei disciples to Peach Blossom Island to retrieve the broken Yitian Jian and Tulong Dao; perhaps you'd like to keep them. After all, both weapons are highly revered symbols in the martial arts world. I hope this small contribution can help the Ming Jiao's struggle."

Zhang Wuji saw that Zhou Zhiruo still harbored guilt for what she did on Snake Island. Unconsciously, he reached for Zhou Zhiruo's hand to comfort her. But Zhou Zhiruo immediately pulled her hand away, her face flushing.

"You really didn't need to do that," Zhang Wuji said. "But since you've already sent people, we will try to repair both weapons. I think Wu Jingcao can do it; he's a great blacksmith. After that, you can keep the Yitian Jian at Emei, and we will keep the Tulong Dao."

Zhou Zhiruo seemed slightly flustered, then said again, "Even so, I think I'll trouble you a bit to deliver the repaired Yitian Jian to Emei and hand it over to Jingxuan *Shijie*[^shijie]; she is now the leader of Emei."

[^shijie]: Shijie (師姐): "Senior Martial Sister". Shi adalah sama seperti dalam Shifu (師父).

They were greatly surprised to hear that statement. Zhang Wuji said, "Isn't...?"

Zhou Zhiruo shook her head, and again said, "I have resigned from my position as leader. Besides, I never wanted to accept it from the start. But at Wan'an Temple, Master forced me, so I had no other choice."

Zhao Min glanced at Zhang Wuji with a look as if to say, "Look, even Zhou Zhiruo can refuse a position, while you can't."

"We'd better quickly meet Zhu Yuanzhang again, otherwise, he'll find a way to evade us," Zhou Zhiruo said again.

"Right," Zhang Wuji said. "Let's go!"
