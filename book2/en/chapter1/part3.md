### Chuzhou, 1355: Roasted Geese by the River

On the second day, Zhang Wuji strolled around Guo Zixing's residence, accompanied by Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min. The area bordered Jiangsu to the east and Huainan to the west. Chuzhou was heavily influenced by seasonal changes. In winter, the weather was very cold. In summer, the weather was hotter than other regions.

At that time, they were at the beginning of winter. They happened to see Xu Da and Chang Yuchun roasting two geese while drinking wine by the river. Upon seeing Zhang Wuji, the two men hurriedly saluted, but Zhang Wuji stopped them and casually said, "We are not in a meeting; there's no need to be so formal. Xu Dage[^dage], do you still remember when we were little, we ate meat amidst a famine, when I was taking Buhui Meimei[^meimei] to Kunlun Shan? Now I want to enjoy that goose meat!"

[^dage]: Dage (大哥): "Big Brother."
[^meimei]: Meimei (妹妹): "Little Sister."

Xu Da burst into laughter, then happily shared his food with Zhang Wuji and Zhao Min. Chang Yuchun broke off a goose thigh and gave it to Zhou Zhiruo. "How quickly time passes," Chang Yuchun said. "I never thought you would grow up to be such a beautiful girl, perhaps soon to become Jiaozhu Furen[^jiaozhu-furen]!"

[^jiaozhu-furen]: Jiaozhu Furen (教主夫人): "Cult Leader's Wife."

Hearing that comment, Zhou Zhiruo blushed, her face turning crimson. "Chang Dage, if you talk nonsense again, I will ignore you," she said. "Zhao Meizi[^meizi-1] here will be the Jiaozhu Furen."

[^meizi-1]: Meizi (妹子): "Little Sister," a term of endearment for a younger female.

Xu Da and Chang Yuchun laughed even louder at that reply. Xu Da offered his wine pouch to Zhang Wuji and said, "Wuji, why not both at once? You three seem very well-suited. Don't let our Commander Zhu outdo you, hahahaha...!"

This time, Zhao Min's face reddened. She knew that Xu Da was an honest man who always spoke frankly. What he had just said, though it sounded rough and playful, was what was in his heart.

Zhang Wuji heard a slightly cynical tone in that last sentence. But he pretended not to notice. Apparently, Xu Da was still somewhat annoyed by Zhu Yuanzhang's attitude, which was why they preferred to keep their distance and drink wine together. He heard Chang Yuchun comment, "Position can change a man. If you were given a position like his, perhaps you would also change."

Xu Da, who seemed a bit drunk, retorted, "Dog's fart position! Whether I'm a beggar or an emperor, I wouldn't cry like that, how shameful!" He took another swig of wine, laughing and biting into the goose breast he held, then began to chew with his eyes closed. "Hmm, this goose meat smells wonderful!" He began to ramble freely as he drank more wine.

Chang Yuchun also drank his own wine, then said seriously, "You'd better start being careful with your words. You know yourself, our Commander has changed now; your words, if heard by others, will have bad consequences."

But Xu Da again said, "I came into this world bringing nothing, and I will leave this world bringing nothing. What's bad about that? If I can't speak, that would be bad!" He then quoted a poem often recited by Ming Jiao members, "What joy is there in living in the world, and what difficulty in death?"

Chang Yuchun said to Zhang Wuji, "Wuji Xiongdi[^xiongdi], do you still remember the first time you wanted to stick a needle into the sole of my foot? At that time, I also thought like Xu Da's words just now. After your needle finally pierced my foot, and I didn't die, from then on, I was never afraid of anything again. In fact, Old Chang is still alive today. When I eat, I can finish six bowls of rice and several kilograms of meat!" He laughed again, taking another swig of wine.

[^xiongdi]: Xiongdi (兄弟): "Brother," a term of camaraderie.

"But I still think you should take your medicine regularly, Chang Dage," Zhang Wuji said. "Later, I will write down a recipe so you can make it yourself. The ingredients can be bought from a regular herbalist."

But Chang Yuchun shook his head and said, "I don't think it's necessary anymore, Wuji Xiongdi. Old Chang is very healthy now. I won't die before witnessing the three of you get married!" He burst into laughter, then bit into the goose meat he held again.

They continued chatting and drinking with Xu Da and Chang Yuchun for a while longer, then returned to Zhu Yuanzhang's residence to deliberate with Shuobude and Fan Yao.

A few days later, Zhang Wuji, Fan Yao, Zhou Zhiruo, and Zhao Min left Chuzhou. But after leaving the city gate, Zhou Zhiruo asked, "Where are you going next?"

Zhang Wuji greatly missed his grand-master; actually, before hearing the news of Guo Zixing's death, he wanted to go to Wudang with the group of Wudang martial artists who were carrying Song Qingshu. Therefore, he said, "I think I'll go directly to Wudang Shan; it's quite far from here. How about you come with us?"

"Us?" Zhou Zhiruo repeated.

Fan Yao said, "Jiaozhu, Fan Yao will return directly to Hangzhou; there are still many tasks to be completed there. The new Song Dynasty is still in great chaos; I don't know what their plans are after this."

"Alright, Fan Youshi[^youshi]," Zhang Wuji said. "After deliberating with Tai Shifu[^tai-shifu], I will rejoin you; there are too many changes I need to carefully consider right now, so we don't make the wrong move." He then entrusted the package containing the Yitian Jian and Tulong Dao to be repaired in Hangzhou. Wu Jingcao was truly a great blacksmith; the weaponry of the Ming Jiao members could be said to be his handiwork.

[^youshi]: Youshi (右使): "Right Emissary," referring to Fan Yao's position.
[^tai-shifu]: Tai Shifu (太師父): "Grand-master," referring to Zhang Sanfeng, Zhang Wuji's grand-master.

Fan Yao bowed respectfully as he received the two weapons, then immediately mounted his horse and headed towards Hangzhou.

The three of them continued walking, leading their respective horses, leaving the city gate; no one spoke. When they were busy at Guo Zixing's residence, they had other things to talk about and important tasks to do. Now Zhang Wuji had decided to go to Wudang to meet Zhang Sanfeng. Without needing to ask, Zhou Zhiruo knew that Zhao Min would definitely follow him.

At this moment, even though Yin Li was still alive, and it seemed Zhang Wuji had forgiven her mistakes on Snake Island, Zhou Zhiruo knew that her actions in Shaolin must have created animosity in the hearts of the Wudang martial artists. She didn't know what Zhang Sanfeng would think if he heard their report. It was true that they considered Song Qingshu and Chen Youliang responsible for Mo Shenggu's death. Yet, in any case, she had also used Song Qingshu to retaliate against Zhang Wuji abandoning her in the middle of their wedding ceremony in Haozhou. And Zhang Sanfeng must have heard reports about that incident.

Now, Zhang Wuji himself wanted to meet Zhang Sanfeng. She didn't know what he would say in front of Zhang Sanfeng. As for Zhao Min, she seemed to want to follow Zhang Wuji to Wudang and confront Zhang Sanfeng without any guilt, even though Zhao Min had previously captured and tortured martial artists from the six major sects in Wulin[^wulin-1]. Both of them were equally guilty. If this cunning little girl dared to face Zhang Sanfeng, how could she not dare?

[^wulin-1]: Wulin (武林): "Martial Forest," referring to the world of martial arts practitioners.

Since Zhang Wuji had offered for her to come with them, she finally said, "Alright, I will go with you to Wudang Shan."

Hearing her words, Zhang Wuji felt delighted. "Tai Shifu will surely be happy to see you," he said.

"Are you sure?" Zhou Zhiruo asked with a bitter smile. "Don't forget, I acted insolently towards your martial uncles in Shaolin, and also, I caused... I caused..." She wanted to mention Song Qingshu's name but then stopped.

For the past few days, Zhang Wuji had been pleased to see Zhou Zhiruo's demeanor return to normal. He had forgotten her cruel actions before. After Zhou Zhiruo herself mentioned them, he remembered, and at the same time, also remembered his act of abandoning Zhou Zhiruo in the middle of their wedding ceremony in Haozhou. When he thought of the calligraphy gift written by his grand-master himself just before that day, he felt great regret. If he heard his martial uncles' report about that incident, Zhang Sanfeng would surely be very disappointed.

Suddenly, Zhao Min laughed. "You don't need to worry," Zhao Min said. As if she could read Zhang Wuji's thoughts, she continued in a light tone, "You still have me, Xiao Yaonu[^xiao-yaonu], whose sins are far greater than everyone else's. I captured your four martial uncles, and my father's three subordinates crippled your sixth uncle, although ultimately my medicine also healed him. Not to mention if people remember the incident in Haozhou, I was the one who caused your wedding to fail." She chuckled as she mounted her horse, then said again, "But I dare to act, I dare to take responsibility. If later your grand-master or martial uncles want to kill me, I will not flee."

[^xiao-yaonu]: Xiao Yaonu (小妖女): Literally "Little Demoness," implying a mischievous or wicked female, often used playfully or to describe someone with an unconventional, perhaps dangerous, charm.

Zhang Wuji and Zhou Zhiruo also mounted their horses. While Zhou Zhiruo secretly admired this little girl's courage, Zhang Wuji said, "You can still laugh while telling that story?"

"Why not?" Zhao Min retorted. "Zhang Jiaozhu, at that time I was indeed helping my father, and my father was an official of the Yuan Dynasty; he was also just carrying out his duties. If you were in his position, you would also do the same."

"Poisoning people, you call that carrying out duties?" Zhang Wuji said. "If it were me, I couldn't do that."

"Hey," Zhao Min said. "You always say what I do is cruel, do you know what the members of the Hongjin Qiyi[^hongjin-qiyi-1] did to the government soldiers and officials they captured?"

[^hongjin-qiyi-1]: Hongjin Qiyi (紅巾起義): The Red Turban Rebellions.

"I don't know," Zhang Wuji replied. "But at least we don't poison them, let alone cut off their fingers." But as he said it, he secretly felt doubtful. Some villagers had apparently witnessed the Red Turban followers cruelly treating their captives, though he didn't hear exactly what they did.

"Hmph," Zhao Min snorted. "Alright, I admit, I didn't witness this myself. I only heard it from my father's story. But I am very sure my father doesn't talk carelessly. If you don't believe it, you can investigate it yourself. I'd also like to hear the results of your investigation."

Zhou Zhiruo and Zhang Wuji had previously seen Han Lin'er curse some local people who praised Emperor Toghon Temur's kindness with a tone full of hatred. Remembering that, they couldn't help but wonder if what Zhao Min said might indeed have happened. The young Han Lin'er was merely influenced by the people around him, but those people themselves were certainly not just talking. Zhang Wuji's heart hardened. "Must not trust Yang Xiao or Peng Yingyu so easily," he thought.

The distance from Chuzhou to Wudang Shan in Hubei was not too far, but it was not close either. Along the way out of that region, they often heard hateful curses from people on the road directed at the Yuan Dynasty and the Mongolians. Then they also heard rows of small children singing poems about the Yellow River and glorifying the rebels.

"What are they singing?" Zhou Zhiruo asked.

"In this area, that kind of song is often heard," Zhang Wuji said. "Disturbing the Yellow River, the people rebel!"

"All of this began with the government's project to dredge and overhaul the Yellow River," Zhao Min said. "Of course, the government had reason to do so, because there had been a great flood previously due to the Yellow River overflowing. Do you have another idea of how to deal with it?"

Zhang Wuji had heard Yang Xiao's explanation about this incident, and after pondering it, even now he couldn't answer Zhao Min's question. All he knew was that after the project was implemented, the people suffered greatly, and poverty was everywhere. In addition, the people mobilized by Toqto'a for the work were also dissatisfied with the payment they received. Because he was still pondering what exactly had happened due to that great project, he did not answer Zhao Min's question.

They were riding leisurely at that time, and looking into the distance, Zhao Min asked, "Do you know who actually rebelled first? Even before that project existed?"

Zhang Wuji was born on Ice and Fire Island, very far from there. Since childhood, he had only known his parents and Xie Xun. They taught him how to read and write, told him many fascinating stories, and also taught him kung fu. But of course, no one taught him about politics in Zhongyuan until he met Yang Xiao, Shuobude, Peng Yingyu, and others. As for Zhou Zhiruo, she had lost her mother since childhood, and her father also died when she was ten years old. Zhang Wuji witnessed that incident. Miejue Shitai often talked about politics and referred to the Mongolians as 'barbarians' with hatred. As a result, she and all Emei disciples were influenced. But upon hearing Zhao Min's question, she had to admit that she did not know.

"As far as I know, Peng Dashi[^dashi] was the first to teach about the 'Brightness King' to the people in the north," Zhang Wuji replied. "That's why Han Shantong was later nicknamed Mingwang, and even 'Maitreya Buddha' by the people. After that, Guo Zixing and others followed their footsteps."

[^dashi]: Dashi (大師): "Grandmaster," a term of respect for a Buddhist monk.

"That only happened later," Zhao Min said. "That is, after we were born. What about before that?"

Zhou Zhiruo laughed. "Even at this point, I don't understand what you two are talking about," she said. "Frankly, I'm never interested in discussing politics like this."

Suddenly Zhang Wuji said casually, "If you want to know, perhaps you can chat with Han Lin'er. I think he will definitely answer all your questions happily." In his heart, Zhang Wuji hoped that by joking a little about Han Lin'er's status, he could see Zhou Zhiruo's reaction and perhaps curb the vague hidden ambition he sensed.

Zhou Zhiruo seemed somewhat upset. She asked, "What do your words mean? Why should I ask Han Lin'er?" She felt offended by Zhang Wuji's words. Why should she deal with a mere boy who had just been enthroned as emperor? Didn't Zhang Wuji know who was truly in her heart all this time? Or was the memory of her completely overshadowed by this little girl's presence now? She didn't believe it! Zhang Wuji should remember what Peng Yingyu had said: that if he became emperor, she — Zhou Zhiruo — would become empress! But of course, she couldn't say such a thing.

Zhao Min burst into laughter. "Zhou Jiejie[^jiejie-1], even now you still don't understand our Wuji Gege[^gege-1]," she said. "Han Lin'er greatly admires you, and he is now an emperor." Zhao Min caught Zhang Wuji's joking tone, although she also sensed the tension between the two.

[^jiejie-1]: Jiejie (姐姐): "Elder Sister."
[^gege-1]: Gege (哥哥): "Elder Brother."

"What kind of person do you think I am?" Zhou Zhiruo said angrily. "Han Lin'er is just a mere boy." She then smiled and said to Zhao Min, "Meizi, I think you're more suitable for Han Lin'er." Zhou Zhiruo, feeling cornered, changed the subject and taunted Zhao Min, considering their relatively close ages. Zhao Min was only about two or three years younger than Han Lin'er.

Zhao Min shook her head, smiling. She said, "You Han people are too busy opposing the government; that's why you don't know what's happening in the palace."

Something in her tone made Zhou Zhiruo curious. "What does it have to do with the palace?"

"You just said Han Lin'er is a mere boy. Do you think the Emperor was an adult when he married Empress Qi, then?" Zhao Min continued. "At that time, the Emperor was only thirteen years old!"

"Who is this Empress Qi?" Zhou Zhiruo asked, surprised.

Once again, Zhao Min laughed. "Of course, the empress of the Yuan Dynasty Emperor, Toghon Temur."

This time Zhang Wuji was astonished. He asked, "Was she a Han woman?"

"No," Zhao Min replied. "She was from Goryeo. She was five years older than the Emperor. So when they married, the Emperor was only thirteen, even younger than Han Lin'er now. Empress Qi was eighteen. Yet, they married."

"That means you're still not too late to become Empress Han Lin'er," Zhang Wuji said with a light laugh.

Zhou Zhiruo was greatly offended and did not respond to his words.

Zhang Wuji realized that his attitude earlier had been somewhat excessive, so he hurriedly said, "Alright, I was a bit out of line earlier. I apologize now."

"Your apology doesn't sound sincere," Zhou Zhiruo said. She turned her gaze elsewhere.

Zhao Min moved her horse closer to Zhou Zhiruo, then said softly, "Zhou Jiejie, never mind him. I think he's just jealous."

"If he could actually be jealous, then you wouldn't have been able to cancel our wedding in Haozhou at that time," Zhou Zhiruo said. She turned to Zhang Wuji and said curtly, "Even if you don't like me, you don't need to throw me to someone else. I don't need your pity."

Zhang Wuji did not respond to her words. At that moment, they were passing an inn, and smelled the fragrant aroma of roast duck coming from inside. He said, "I'm very hungry; how about we stop there?"

"I'm hungry too," Zhao Min said happily. She immediately invited Zhou Zhiruo to dismount, then they entered the inn hand in hand. Zhang Wuji thought, "Women are difficult to understand. Now I've become the villain, and the two of them are like sisters. All just because of a joke about Han Lin'er."

They ate without much talk; only Zhao Min eagerly finished two bowls of rice and tasted two kinds of vegetable dishes. Lately, she had diligently practiced all the moves she had learned from Fan Yao and all the techniques she had 'stolen' from the six major sects. Fan Yao had not given her any lessons regarding internal energy (neili) or qinggong. All her training utilized her arm and leg muscles, and because she was still a teenager, all that food made her grow taller and stronger. She now appeared more athletic and required more food.

Suddenly Zhang Wuji remembered something and asked, "Did you mean Empress Qi was the one who rebelled earlier?"

"No," Zhao Min said. "This has to do with Kusala, Emperor Toghon Temur's father. But he wasn't the one who rebelled either. Specifically, there was a series of rebellions in the palace, until eventually El Temur gained power as Prime Minister and also the Regent[^jianguo] for the emperor."

[^jianguo]: Jian Guo (監國): "Regent" or "Supervisor of the State," one who governs in the place of a monarch.

Zhang Wuji had never heard this story. "How could such a thing happen?" he asked.

"At that time, the Grand Council of the Yuan Dynasty was divided into two groups," Zhao Min said, filling her empty bowl with boiled peanuts, sliced onions, and chilies. "The first supported orthodox Mongolian ways, and the second preferred Confucius's[^kongzi] teachings and wanted to implement a system of government like the Han Dynasty, which is why they learned much from the Han people. They also dared to pay Han teachers handsomely. Kusala, the current Emperor's father, belonged to this second group. Or rather, he spearheaded this movement. At that time, he had many supporters in the palace, and El Temur greatly disliked him." She cleared her throat, glanced at Zhou Zhiruo, adding in a slightly different tone, "It's quite interesting, too, if later there is an emperor who has empresses from both Han and Naiman tribes."

[^kongzi]: Kong Zi (孔子): Confucius, a renowned Chinese philosopher.

"Wow, I never thought the story was so complicated," Zhang Wuji said, pretending not to understand the last sentence.

Only then did Zhou Zhiruo become interested in hearing Zhao Min's political story. "That sounds very interesting," she said, her eyes beginning to sparkle. "Khayishan dared to defy his mother and marry a woman from another tribe? I suppose what happened next can be guessed: Ayurbarwada broke his promise!"

Zhao Min nodded. "Correct, but it wasn't Ayurbarwada who broke the promise. After Ayurbarwada died, almost all members of the Khonggirad tribe agreed to enthrone Ayurbarwada's son, Shidibala, as Khan, and also Emperor of the Yuan Dynasty. Their reason, of course, was that Kusala was the son of an Ikhires woman. To ensure the plan went smoothly, Kusala was exiled to Yunnan, but was granted the title of King of Chou."

"That's so cruel, again just because he was the son of a woman from another tribe!" Zhou Zhiruo said. It was unclear to Zhang Wuji what was on Zhou Zhiruo's mind when she said this. If among Mongolian families, 'another tribe' here could indeed refer to Zhou Zhiruo herself, but interpreted from another side, it seemed like she was defending Zhao Min.

He asked, "Why was only Kusala exiled? Wasn't Tugh Temur also Khayishan's son?"

Zhao Min secretly felt pleased hearing Zhou Zhiruo's words about 'women from foreign tribes,' but she replied in a normal tone, "Of course, because Tugh Temur was not the crown prince. Therefore, he was considered not dangerous. But don't think Shidibala lived safely on the throne in the end. He was later killed by Yesun Temur in a coup. This Yesun Temur then became Khan. Now, after he died, the war between the two capitals, Shangdu and Dadu, occurred. Ragibagh, Yesun Temur's son, ascended the throne, but then Tugh Temur, who lived in Dadu, rebelled against him, with El Temur's support. General Bayan, who was then the governor of Henan, also supported him."

"This is an amazing story, why have I never heard it?" Zhang Wuji said. He had often heard Fan Yao and Yang Xiao's stories about the war between the two capitals. They seemed to boast a bit about their experience plundering the homes of the wealthy during this period, but he had never heard about the political reasons behind it.

"Because after that series of rebellions ended with the victory of Tugh Temur's faction, rebellions from the Han people finally began, starting with Zhou Ziwang!" Zhao Min replied.

"Ah, that name was mentioned by Chang Yuchun when my father died at the Han River," Zhou Zhiruo said. "At that time, Zhou Ziwang's son also died."

"You certainly know, Han Shantong was greatly influenced by Peng Dashi's teachings about the coming of Maitreya Buddha, and then people believed that he was the coming Maitreya Buddha. That's why you never heard about what happened in the palace; people were only busy talking about this."

Zhang Wuji was just beginning to understand what was really behind all these rebellions. He knew that before starting his rebellion, Liu Futong was a Yuan Dynasty official. And later, he became Han Shantong's advisor. Currently, he was Han Lin'er's advisor, also the Grand Advisor of the new Song Dynasty, and simultaneously held the position of Prime Minister. He felt his decision to closely monitor Liu Futong was correct, and he felt relieved. "Min Mei, you still haven't told us how Emperor Toghon Temur finally ascended the throne," he said.

"Well, after Tugh Temur ascended the throne, he finally invited Kusala back to Dadu," Zhao Min replied. "At that time, Kusala brought a large amount of military support from the Chagatai faction to Mongolia, to Karakorum. Seeing this, the princes in Karakorum immediately supported him. Eventually, Tugh Temur became frightened by that military power; he was under great pressure. Kusala declared himself the Great Khan in Mongolia, and two months later, El Temur arrived with the imperial seal in Mongolia. He announced that Dadu's side intended to support Kusala. A month later, Kusala retaliated by appointing his younger brother, Tugh Temur, as Crown Prince."

"It seems Kusala was a good emperor," Zhang Wuji said.

Zhao Min smiled. "He was indeed good, but unfortunately, he never truly became an Emperor or Khan," she said. "Do you think others will repay a chivalrous act with the same?"

"What happened next?" Zhou Zhiruo asked.

"Kusala departed from Karakorum with only eighteen hundred men to Dadu. Two months later, he met Tugh Temur in Ongguchatu. There, Tugh Temur had built the city of Zhongdu. Kusala suddenly died four days after a banquet with Tugh Temur. A month later, Tugh Temur ascended the throne a second time, as the Great Khan of Mongolia and simultaneously the Emperor of the Yuan Dynasty."

"Crazy!" Zhang Wuji exclaimed in shock. Unconsciously, he slapped the edge of the table. "Absolutely cruel! Killing his own brother."

Zhang Wuji had heard stories from Xie Xun and Zhang Sanfeng about the Song Dynasty Emperor Huizong, who pretended to abdicate and handed the throne to his son, Qinzong, for fear of the Jin invasion. Qinzong was initially afraid to accept the throne, also fearing the invading Jin, until Huizong ordered a eunuch to force Qinzong onto the throne. Ironically, both emperors were eventually captured by the invading Jin, who established the Jin Dynasty in the northern regions. This humiliating incident for the Song Dynasty caused their territory to be halved, and as a result, it was named Southern Song. Qinzong's younger brother, Zhao Gou, who fled south, managed to preserve the Song Dynasty, albeit only half of it. But then, when the Jin intended to release Qinzong due to pressure from General Yuefei, he feared that Qinzong would reclaim the throne, which was rightfully his, so he halted General Yuefei's campaign against the Jin, even though Yuefei was on the verge of victory. At this moment, Zhang Wuji felt a similarity between the actions of Zhao Gou, who eventually became Emperor Gaozong, and Tugh Temur's actions.

"For the throne, people can do anything," Zhou Zhiruo said. She had also heard the same story from Miejue Shitai. She felt it was truly insane that she had previously been happy when she heard Peng Yingyu say that she would become Zhang Wuji's empress once their struggle against the Yuan Dynasty succeeded. When Zhao Min talked about Khayishan being opposed by his own mother, she shivered, imagining a mother causing her two own sons to fight each other over the throne.
