### *Chuzhou, 1355: Alpha And Omega*


When they arrived at Guo Zixing's residence, Zhu Yuanzhang had already returned to receiving mourners in front of the coffin, and they did not see the presence of Xu Da and Chang Yuchun. Ma Xiuying, Zhu Yuanzhang's wife, who was heavily pregnant, seemed busy attending to guests beside her husband. As many people were still arriving to pay their last respects to Guo Zixing, they did not wish to disturb and simply sat with other guests, enjoying the provided refreshments.

Zhao Min shamelessly tasted the sweet cakes made by Ma Xiuying, Zhu Yuanzhang's wife. Zhou Zhiruo, who had been skilled in making food since childhood in Emei, noticed that most of these small delicacies were made from rice and wheat flour. The method of making them was quite unique and somewhat different from the snacks she usually made for Miejue Shitai in Emei.

Miejue Shitai indeed greatly enjoyed Zhou Zhiruo's cooking but would harshly reprimand her if she spent too long in the kitchen. After she grew older, Miejue Shitai always supervised her training more strictly. But because Zhou Zhiruo was naturally talented at cooking, she would still set aside plenty of time in the kitchen. The pressure from Ding Minjun, who was envious of her master always favoring Zhou Zhiruo, intentionally asking her to make difficult dishes, actually proved very challenging for Zhou Zhiruo.

They took the opportunity when the number of guests thinned out, then greeted Zhu Yuanzhang and the rest of Guo Zixing's family. Guo Tianxu and Guo Tianyou's mother was also present and bowed respectfully upon seeing Zhang Wuji. Ma Xiuying, Zhu Yuanzhang's pregnant wife, also bowed. Upon seeing Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min, she mistook the two women for Zhang Wuji's wives, then politely bowed to both of them, greeting, "Please, both Furen, forgive us; so many people have been coming since earlier, so we couldn't attend to both Furen properly."

Blushing, Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min quickly prevented her from bowing. "Dasao[^dasao] doesn't need to do this," Zhou Zhiruo said gracefully. "We are not Jiaozhu Furen." Both immediately introduced themselves as Zhang Wuji's friends, their faces red.

[^dasao]: Dasao (大嫂): "Elder Sister-in-Law."

Seeing this, Ma Xiuying began to understand. Wisely, she did not inquire further about the relationship between Zhang Wuji and the two of them.

At that moment, without wasting any more time, Shuobude asked, "Zhu Yuanzhang, why didn't you capture Chen Yexian alive and kill him immediately?"

Zhu Yuanzhang was surprised, but a moment later, he replied, "Dashi, in the battle at that time, Zaixia[^zaixia] did not know who killed him."

[^zaixia]: Zaixia (在下): A humble self-reference, roughly equivalent to "your humble servant" or "I."

"But you knew before that he was a former government official, didn't you?" Fan Yao asked sharply.

At that moment, Zhao Min saw Ma Xiuying tremble, staring intently at her husband, and although it was only for a second, she managed to catch a faint signal from Zhu Yuanzhang. Zhou Zhiruo, who also saw this, immediately took Zhao Min's hand and said to Ma Xiuying, "Dasao, we've been wanting to ask how Dasao makes those sesame-sprinkled cakes; we really like them. Perhaps Dasao could tell us how."

The two of them invited Ma Xiuying to sit in another room.

Zhang Wuji said to Zhu Yuanzhang after the three women left, "Zhu Dage, we should talk in another room."

Zhu Yuanzhang led them to a smaller, empty room. After Zhu Yuanzhang closed the door, Fan Yao spoke again, "Zhu Yuanzhang, state the main rule number three of the Ming Jiao!"

Zhu Yuanzhang had no choice and recited what he had memorized, "Ming Jiao members are strictly forbidden from fighting each other, let alone killing fellow members."

"Good!" said Fan Yao. "Then why did you kill Guo Tianxu and Guo Tianyou?"

"Fan Yooshi, Zaixia did not kill them," Zhu Yuanzhang replied. "They died on the battlefield."

"It's true you didn't kill them with your own hands," Shuobude said. "But you deliberately arranged for them to lead the front lines, and you did nothing to support them. You also encouraged your subordinates to do the same—Jian Si Bu Jiu[^jian-si-bu-jiu]—this is tantamount to murder!"

[^jian-si-bu-jiu]: Jian Si Bu Jiu (見死不救): A Chinese idiom literally meaning 'to see someone dying but not help them,' implying a deliberate refusal to offer assistance to someone in peril.

Hearing this, Zhu Yuanzhang quickly knelt before Zhang Wuji and said with tears in his eyes, "Jiaozhu, please forgive me—it is true what Shuobude Dashi said, but from the beginning, Guo Tianxu and Guo Tianyou always wanted to kill Zaixia. In this matter, Zaixia truly had no other choice. If Jiaozhu truly considers Zaixia guilty, then Zaixia can only accept the appropriate punishment. But Zaixia knows Jiaozhu is very wise and not someone who punishes carelessly."

Meanwhile, in another room, Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo gently held the pregnant Ma Xiuying's hand, then invited her to sit comfortably in a chair. When the woman again wanted to pay her respects to them, Zhao Min quickly stopped her and said, "Dasao, we know what Dasao is worried about. But believe us, Zhang Jiaozhu is not someone who acts without consideration. It's just that actions like this must not happen again."

Ma Xiuying sobbed and stammered, "I tried... to prevent it... This has happened several times... several times... I mean he... my husband tried to warn them several times... But they always wanted to kill him... In the end, he had no other choice..."

Zhou Zhiruo gently said, "Dasao, in this world, no human has never made a mistake. Xiaomei and Zhao Meizi here also made mistakes, and even Zhang Jiaozhu is the same. But if Jiaozhu simply allows what Zhu Dage did, without doing anything, then great chaos will ensue. Many people will imitate, and recklessly kill those they dislike, or kill each other without regard for rules anymore. But Xiaomei believes, Zhang Jiaozhu will still forgive this action. Nevertheless, if I may ask Dasao to cooperate with us to prevent the same incident from recurring. Wouldn't this be very good? As women, Xiaomei feels this is the best action we can take, right?"

Hearing Zhou Zhiruo's words, Ma Xiuying seemed calmer. But a moment later, she rose from her chair, then wanted to kneel to pay her respects. Zhou Zhiruo and Zhao Min again stopped her and helped her back to her seat. "Miss Zhou, Miss Zhao," Ma Xiuying said. "In these cruel times, it is truly rare to meet people like you. I know you two are very close to Jiaozhu. Next time, this foolish me will surely need much advice from both of you. I know my husband can sometimes be uncontrollable, but I also know he truly cares for the people's interests. I beg you both to understand his actions this time."

Zhao Min said, "Dasao, as long as we know what happened, next time we will surely be able to help Dasao prevent such actions from occurring."

She knew that from now on, they would hear more often from Ma Xiuying. And this woman was a good ally. This way, at least they would be able to control Zhu Yuanzhang's actions.

The two of them continued to accompany Ma Xiuying in that room, chatting about the food recipes Zhou Zhiruo had asked about.

Zhang Wuji intended to help Zhu Yuanzhang, who was still kneeling without daring to look at him, to stand up. But both Fan Yao and Shuobude signaled him not to do so.

Instead, Fan Yao said sharply, "Zhu Yuanzhang, you know Jiaozhu is kind and does not punish carelessly, and you deliberately want to take advantage of his kindness to save yourself?"

"Zaixia does not dare," Zhu Yuanzhang replied without raising his head to look at Fan Yao.

"Now tell us, for this kind of mistake, how should you be punished?" Fan Yao asked again.

Zhu Yuanzhang knew that this rule was set by Zhang Wuji, and whoever violated it must be expelled from the Ming Jiao. In the past, before Zhang Wuji led, such violations would result in execution or the cutting off of a limb. But even though the Red Turban Army led by his father-in-law was a branch of the Ming Jiao, their teachings were not truly the same. Nevertheless, if he argued with Fan Yao now, it was not impossible that Fan Yao would impose a heavier punishment, and Zhang Wuji would agree to it, even though if he were expelled from the Ming Jiao, he would naturally lose all the soldiers he had painstakingly gathered so far, and could not dream of taking over the leadership of all Guo Zixing's forces. Therefore, he hurriedly knocked his forehead three times on the floor and said, "Zaixia can only accept whatever punishment Jiaozhu imposes."

Actually, Zhu Yuanzhang was unwilling to accept the fact that he had to submit to Zhang Wuji, whom he had known since childhood. Although he felt Zhang Wuji understood nothing, his kung fu was extremely high, no one could match him; this was a fact he had to accept whether he liked it or not. Moreover, let alone ordinary Ming Jiao members, even Han Shantong, Xu Shouhui, and Guo Zixing greatly respected him. If Zhang Wuji had wanted to impose a death sentence, his life would surely have been lost at that moment. Therefore, he humbled himself and made up his mind, then uttered that last sentence. He remained kneeling without raising his head, waiting for Zhang Wuji's decision.

For a moment, Zhang Wuji was in a dilemma. If he did not punish Zhu Yuanzhang, the rules he had set would continue to be ignored, and similar incidents would continue to occur. But he had known Zhu Yuanzhang since childhood. Furthermore, it was currently very logical for Zhu Yuanzhang to lead Guo Zixing's forces. He had witnessed the might of the troops under Zhu Yuanzhang's command when they fought in Shaolin. It would be a great loss to expel Zhu Yuanzhang from the Ming Jiao, let alone impose a death penalty just because this person did something that caused Guo Tianxu and Guo Tianyou to die. After all, those two were also guilty of trying to kill Zhu Yuanzhang several times. Besides, Fan Yao had also committed a similar violation by killing Ming Jiao members to convince Chaghan Temur of his loyalty.

Moreover, he himself was secretly planning a major change, which would surely surprise everyone, although he currently did not feel sure what he would say to all these Ming Jiao officials. It was precisely a person like Zhu Yuanzhang who would be capable of doing something he himself could not. This made him think even deeper.

A few seconds later, he stepped forward to help Zhu Yuanzhang stand up, then said, "Zhu Dage, frankly, I am deeply troubled by this incident. Zhu Dage should have reported such disputes to us, and we would surely have acted with utmost fairness. But I do not wish for this incident to break our unity. So I will still allow all the soldiers currently under Zhu Dage's command to remain as they are. However, regarding the remaining soldiers, the Emperor[^kaisar-1] will decide. In this way, we still uphold the existing rules, and Zhu Dage will still receive a punishment. From now on, Shuobude Dashi will lead this area as supervisor until the Han Brothers issue an official decision regarding the leadership of the forces. Zhu Dage must report all plans he wishes to carry out to Shuobude Dashi, down to the smallest detail. If Shuobude Dashi does not allow it, it means the action must not be carried out. If Dage violates the rules again, we will certainly impose a heavy punishment. I hope Zhu Dage can accept this decision."

[^kaisar-1]: In this context, the Emperor referred to by Zhang Wuji is Han Lin'er, who was about to be crowned as the new Emperor of the Song Dynasty in Bozhou.

[^shouxia]: Shouxia (手下): "Subordinate" or "Underling."

With heartfelt sincerity, Zhu Yuanzhang knocked his forehead on the floor repeatedly, then said, "Shouxia[^shouxia] will obey all of Jiaozhu's commands with all his heart. Jiaozhu is truly wise."

With that decision, Shuobude was forced to stay in Chuzhou as supervisor for the troops and members previously under Guo Zixing's leadership. Zhang Wuji, Fan Yao, Zhou Zhiruo, and Zhao Min still stayed for a few days at Guo Zixing's family residence to discuss what Shuobude needed to do there.
