# Prologue

### Henan 1354

Chaghan Temur stroked his thick beard with his left hand, deep in thought. He was not a man easily intimidated. He knew well that his daughter was full of cunning tricks and very astute. In truth, he had no objection to having a son-in-law like Zhang Wuji, if only he could find a way to evade the accusations from the court that he and his family intended to rebel, but unfortunately, no such solution had presented itself. He remained silent for a long time without uttering a single word.

He himself had married at a very young age, and his wife was several years older than him. When he married, he was only thirteen years old. Since he was a man, and Zhao Min's mother was older than him, he wasn't entirely sure if Zhao Min's recent declaration that she had secretly become Zhang Wuji's wife could be believed. But he knew Empress Bayan had married at thirteen and soon after gave birth to her first child. Zhao Min was currently only twelve years old, and judging by her physique, Chaghan knew clearly that Zhao Min had not yet reached puberty. So, in any case, Zhao Min's bluff about secretly becoming Zhang Wuji's wife was indeed highly dubious.

Perhaps due to her immense curiosity, Zhao Min had already learned about marital relations from others. Perhaps from one of his concubines, or even from her own mother, but for Chaghan, it was highly unlikely that this mere child had engaged in marital relations with Zhang Wuji, who was much older than her and surely regarded her as nothing more than a child. With this thought, Chaghan calmed down. He had secretly decided to grant his daughter's wish to marry Zhang Wuji, though certainly not in the way Zhao Min imagined.


After dismissing everyone, including Wang Baobao, Chaghan took another deep breath before slowly saying, "Wuji, I know who you truly are, so there's no need for us to pretend anymore. Here, it's just the three of us. But before I speak further, I want to ask, what do you think the *Ming Jiao*[^ming-jiao] actually is?"

[^ming-jiao]: Ming Jiao (明教), "The Brightness Teaching".
[^moni-jiao]: Moni Jiao (摩尼教), "The Teaching of Mani".

Zhang Wuji was greatly surprised. Chaghan Temur's question hit the mark precisely. Ever since speaking with Zhang Zhong in Dadu, this was what he had been thinking about day and night, and although he could vaguely answer the question, what he understood was deeply unsatisfying. He said, "Wangye, from what Wuji can currently understand, the Ming Jiao is a religious sect originating from Persia. But frankly, Zhang Wuji's knowledge is truly too shallow to fully comprehend its teachings."

"Indeed," Chaghan said with a friendly smile. "You are wise. That answer is very honest. And I can say, not just you, even I don't have enough understanding to fully grasp it. But perhaps you don't know, some of my ancestors were also adherents of the Ming Jiao. In Tang Dynasty, this religion was called *Moni Jiao*."[^moni-jiao]

This time, Zhang Wuji was truly stunned; he fell silent, unable to utter a word.

"I will also tell you now," Chaghan continued after seeing Zhang Wuji's shock. "Actually, although I myself am not a Ming Cult adherent, I can see that its teachings are very valuable to implement here in Zhongyuan, and could become a savior in regions like Fujian and Henan, where the population consists of various peoples with many seemingly conflicting beliefs. But after hearing my confession, can you say that my family and I oppose the Ming Cult?"

After a long silence, Zhang Wuji finally said, "Wuji understands what Wangye means. Wangye indeed cannot oppose the Ming Cult. What Wangye opposes is rebellion."

"You are very intelligent," Chaghan Temur said, pleased. "You immediately understood my intention. Now we will talk about this — rebellion. You always talk about expelling the Mongols. Who do you think I am?"

Zhang Wuji had been observing Chaghan Temur closely, and he was very surprised. Wang Baobao's appearance indeed had typical Mongolian features, with somewhat high cheekbones and narrower eyes compared to the southern inhabitants. But Chaghan Temur's eyes were not narrow at all. His face clearly showed he was from the western regions, likely influenced by Persians or even Turks. His body was tall and large, with a thick, bearded face. His aquiline nose was thin, with thin lips. He often saw foreign people from the west with such features after Kublai Khan conquered Zhongyuan and established the Yuan Dynasty, but he could not answer Chaghan Temur's question. Zhao Min only inherited his aquiline, thin nose and his tall stature, but otherwise, she was completely different. Finally, he said, "Zhang Wuji truly does not know. Please, Wangye, explain."

Smiling faintly, Chaghan said, "My ancestors came from the Naiman tribe. Genghis Khan conquered our tribe, and since then, we have assimilated with the Mongols and become 'Mongolians.' Originally, my ancestors lived in Beshbalik. After Kublai Khan founded this Yuan Dynasty, they moved to Henan. Well, I myself was born in Henan. So how can you say that I oppose the people of Zhongyuan? Tell me, if you expel me, where do you want me to go? I was born in Zhongyuan, so for me, my homeland is Henan! You want to expel me from my own birthplace?"

Something seemed to strike Zhang Wuji's mind, but at that moment he couldn't explain exactly what, and where exactly Chaghan Temur's words had disturbed him. Chaghan Temur's words were spoken patiently, as if talking to his own child, "Wuji, to change the law, one must indeed overthrow the state and rebuild it. Another path we can take is to enter the government as officials. But most who enter eventually become corrupt and drown in political games for power and wealth, forgetting their original purpose for joining. Therefore, the simplest thing we can do, if we don't want to be directly involved, is to govern our own regions well. If you live in Kaifeng, govern Kaifeng well. If in Jiangnan, govern that place well. If the current laws we feel are biased and favor one side, there are still many ways to help the people and create justice. For me, there is nothing worse than a region without law and without government. People will become savage, then do as they please, and ultimately the most powerful person will rule there. In other words — usually — a bandit."

At this point, Zhang Wuji was truly astonished. He had never heard anyone elaborate on this issue in such a way as Chaghan Temur. He had to admit that his explanation was correct. But what Yang Xiao and the others had put forward also felt right to him. He said, "Wangye, currently the government oppresses the people. A poor citizen will certainly be heavily punished if they do something contrary to an official. But that official may not be punished, even if they actually violate justice by killing innocent common people."

"Do you think I don't know about this?" Chaghan Temur said again. "Now I want to ask again. In the area around Ruyang Wangfu, have you found such cases? If you do, report them to me immediately, and I myself will behead the official who did it!"

Zhang Wuji was silent once more. He never forgot how Zhao Min had dealt with Yuan Dynasty soldiers who oppressed the people. Undoubtedly, this must have been the result of Chaghan Temur's upbringing. Without even careful inspection, he was very confident that in Chaghan's domain, it would be difficult to find officials who dared to violate the law and commit injustice by exploiting legal loopholes. Even if they managed to escape punishment, then the Eight Divine Arrows would secretly act to eliminate them without giving them a chance to speak further. This was the method used by martial arts heroes (Wulin) to bring justice to the people throughout history. Those who ignored the law, or sought loopholes in its weaknesses for gain, were also ignored by Chaghan in the law to eliminate them.

Chaghan gazed into the distance, his eyes narrowing, though they were not actually narrow. He let out a long sigh before continuing his narrative, "This is precisely what is happening in many places now. Isn't it very sad if our tranquil home suddenly turns into a den of thieves after the arrival of some people, who claim to come to help the people? Do you know why I rarely appear in the Assembly Hall? Because that's where all the big-time criminals are entrenched! As soon as I set foot there, people immediately twist what I do, turning it into their own advantage; I'm fortunate if I avoid the misfortune of becoming a criminal. That's why I eventually feel unable to do anything beyond my own sphere of influence. If you ask about Ruyang, I can answer, but about other regions, I will say I don't know." He stared intently at Zhang Wuji, asking, "Where were you born?"

Suddenly, Zhang Wuji felt as if he were a stranger in Zhongyuan. He answered somewhat hesitantly, "Wangye, frankly, Wuji was born on an island, very far from here. On that island, there was no one but my parents and my adoptive father — Xie Xun. My mother called it Binghuo Dao."

"Hmm! That sounds like an island in the far north, close to Siberia," Chaghan Temur said. "No wonder you don't understand what's really happening here at all. This way, you'll be easily swayed by everyone in Zhongyuan who actually just wants to use you for their own gain. Have you seen the refugees from the northern regions due to floods and other natural disasters? Most of them are victims of the great flood caused by the overflowing Huang He[^huang-he]. Such disasters are truly heartbreaking, and they seem to happen year after year. Now, that problem has actually been resolved, at least not as bad as before, although as a result, rebellions arose in those southern regions. Do you know who solved this flood problem?"

[^huang-he]: Huang He (黄河) is the Yellow River.

Since he had discussed this matter with Zhang Zhong before, Zhang Wuji could now answer confidently, "Wuji knows about this. That person is Toqto'a!"

"You are right," Chaghan Temur said. "He is my superior. In this matter, I don't care how many people oppose him, but I personally believe he is a righteous man. Such a project naturally requires a lot of labor. It's not a problem if they merely grumble because they are dissatisfied with the payment they receive. But then some people want to use that opportunity to build a rebellion. So, at the official level, Toqto'a is opposed, and at the popular level, people are using the results of his work to find ways to build rebellion! Truly ironic, this is what a righteous man must endure. I cannot tell you the details of what is happening in the palace right now. I want to ask one more thing. Do you two know who those Tibetan monks actually are?"

This time, Zhao Min was also amazed. But Zhang Wuji immediately replied, "Aren't they Wangye's own subordinates?"

Chaghan Temur snorted, then said, "You must know. Emperor Toghon Temur is a devout follower of the Tibetan Buddhist Karma Kagyu lineage. He himself invited experts from this lineage to the palace to learn from them. One of them, who now holds an important position, is named Hama. All those monks are Hama's subordinates. They are placed near me to monitor me. They must obey my orders, but they must also report all my activities to their superior. I also want to tell you now. Hama will soon try to control the palace, and Emperor Toghon Temur will be in his grasp. People like Hama are our true enemies. These monks merely follow their superiors' orders, and I cannot consider them evil. But I also have no way to drive them away."

Zhang Wuji and Zhao Min were greatly shocked. "Father, what will you do then?" Zhao Min asked.

Chaghan sighed sadly, then said, "I told you, your actions will surely trouble me. If Wuji were not directly connected to the Ming Cult, the story would be very different. But I know he certainly wouldn't want to leave the Ming Cult at a time like this, and I don't want him to either, because precisely by becoming the Ming Cult leader, he will be able to do something for the people, but not in the current way. The only way to avoid disaster is for you to no longer be my daughter. Therefore..." He shifted his gaze to Zhang Wuji, "from now on, I entrust Minmin — my beloved daughter — to you alone. Take good care of her. I trust you will not disappoint my hopes. I only want to warn you of one important thing. Currently, Zhang Shicheng is rebelling in Jiangsu, and Toqto'a will certainly fight him. I don't know what will happen next. But don't let you and I face each other as enemies on the battlefield, because at that time, I will certainly carry out my superiors' orders. I myself would rather die by your hand than have to kill you, because — now that it has come to this — I now regard you as my son-in-law, which means my own child. I will try to avoid war, but if the given order is truly well-founded, how can I refuse it?"

Zhang Wuji was so moved he nearly shed tears. He stammered, "Wangye... I..."

But Chaghan Temur raised his right hand as a signal for him to stop talking. He said, "Our time is very short. I actually wanted to talk at length with you, but now it's no longer possible. Go as far as you can. Regarding Yuanzhen Dashi, I don't know where he is. I don't think he's too far from Shaolin. But Chen Youliang, you must be careful dealing with him. The problems that occurred in Kai Pang have nothing to do with me. Both of them have very great ambitions, and in my opinion, they are not good at all. That's all I can say. Go!"

He turned around, then waved to Wang Baobao and all his followers who were waiting far away. Once again, he turned to Zhang Wuji and said kindly, "Even if you still want to continue on this path, I suggest you carefully read about what Zhao Kuangyin did before he founded the Song Dynasty. Perhaps you haven't heard, Zhao Kuangyin also came from Henan." Then he walked gloomily down the hill, leading his horse. He didn't even ride it. Quickly, Wang Baobao and the others arrived near him and followed him.

Zhang Wuji and Zhao Min remained stunned in their original spot, watching them leave. But about twenty paces later, Chaghan Temur turned back and said in a loud voice, "Minmin, do you still have money?"

Swallowing her own tears, Zhao Min nodded without speaking.

To his personal guards, Chaghan said, "Give my two best horses to Junzhu."

One of his personal guards assented, then took two horses and gave them to Zhao Min, then followed Chaghan Temur down the hill. The Tibetan monks who were injured after fighting Zhang Wuji also followed them. In an instant, everyone was gone, and only Zhang Wuji and Zhao Min remained on the hill, still pondering everything General Chaghan Temur had said.
